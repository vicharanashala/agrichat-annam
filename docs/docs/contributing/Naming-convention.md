## General Rules

- Use lowercase letters only.
- Separate words with hyphens (`-`), not underscores or spaces.
- Start with a prefix that describes the file's purpose.
- Keep names concise and descriptive.
- Add markdown description for functionality used in the class or function.

## Best Practices

- **Be Descriptive:**  
  Make the purpose of the branch clear from its name.

- **Keep It Short:**  
  Use only as many words as needed to describe the change.

- **Use Issue Numbers:**  
  If the branch addresses a specific issue or ticket, include its number for easy tracking.

- **Avoid Generic Names:**  
  Do not use branch names like `update`, `changes`, or `fix`.

- **Stay Consistent:**  
  Ensure everyone on the team follows these conventions.
