**1. INTRODUCTION**

Animal Husbandry sector plays a vital role in
sustaining rural livelihoods and improving the
economy of rural population. Livestock sector
provides productive employment especially self
employment and guaranteed supplementary
household income to a majority of rural households
particularly small and marginal farmers besides
providing nutritious food products like milk, meat
and eggs. The live animals are important natural
assets for the poor, which can be easily liquidated
### 1


for cash during emergency. Livestock have
remained an integral part of the socio-economic
fabric of rural people since time immemorial, not
only as a source of livelihood but also as a provider
of draught energy, manure and fuel.

Sustained rise in income and urbanization are

now fuelling rapid growth in demand for animal food
products and the livestock are coming under
pressure to produce more. Over the last three
decades livestock production grew faster than crop
sector as a whole and has made significant
contributions to agricultural growth, which is
considered to be an important factor in poverty
reduction among rural people.

Livestock Revolution is also significantly
contributing towards improving nutritional security
and reducing rural poverty. The rural poor have
little access to agriculture land and thus there are
limited opportunities for them in crop production.
On the other hand, livestock wealth is equitably
distributed compared to land, and generates
opportunities for the poor to escape poverty
through livestock production.

The contribution of livestock sector to the

Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) is
4.31% and that to the agriculture and allied
activities is 41.84% (Advanced Estimate at Current
Prices). During 2006-07, the gross value of
### 2


-----

output of livestock, which was 11,535.23 crore in
the State has increased to Rs.55,068.20 crore
during 2014-15 (Advanced Estimate at Current
Prices). The estimated milk production, which was
54.74 lakh Metric Tonnes during 2005-06 in Tamil
Nadu, has increased to 71.32 lakh Metric Tonnes
during 2014-15. Likewise, the estimated egg
production, which was 62,225 lakh numbers during
2005-06 has increased to 1,59,253 lakh numbers
during 2014-15.

The per capita availability of milk per day and
eggs per annum has increased from 231 gms and
100 numbers during 2005-06 to 257 gms and
209 numbers during 2014-15 respectively. Apart
from these, the estimated meat production
(including poultry meat), which was 1,186 lakh kgs
during 2005-06 has increased to 4,919 lakh kgs
during 2014-15. The State contributes 5.12% of
milk production, 19.23% of egg production and
7.45% of total meat production (including poultry
meat) and ranked 10 [th] in milk production, 1 [st] in egg
production and 6 [th] in meat production in the country
during 2014-15.

The Animal Husbandry Department plays a
major role in implementing various programmes
effectively and providing veterinary assistance,
health care and breeding services to the livestock
and poultry reared by the farmers in the State
### 3


through a network of 2,679 Veterinary Institutions
and 800 Veterinary Sub-Centres. Further, Mobile
Veterinary Units also provide veterinary services to
the livestock of the farmers residing in remote
areas at their doorsteps. This timely services results
in increased production of livestock products like
milk, meat and egg.

The State Government is also successfully
progressing towards its objective of increasing the
milk production in order to achieve a ‘Second White

Revolution’ in the State. Hon’ble Chief Minister’s

“Tamil Nadu Vision 2023” envisages making Tamil
Nadu the 'Numero Uno' State by achieving a target
of 11 per cent growth in Gross State Domestic
Product (GSDP), for which contribution of primary
sectors like Agriculture and its allied sectors like
Animal Husbandry is inevitable.

The Hon'ble Chief Minister has given special
emphasis to the Animal Husbandry sector, for
ensuring the welfare of the rural poor. “Free

distribution of Milch Cows and Free distribution of

Goats / Sheep” to poor women in rural areas were
launched by Hon’ble Chief Minister. These schemes
aim at achieving the twin objectives of economic
improvement of rural women by empowering them
with sustainable income generating livestock and to

usher in a radiant white revolution in the State.

Since the inception of the scheme during
### 4


-----

2011-12 till 2014-15, 22 lakh goats /sheep and

48 thousand milch cows have been distributed to

poor needy families. These animals have given birth
to  31.14 lakh kids and 47,971 calves respectively.
Further, 1.70 lakh litres of milk is being produced
every day from the milch cows distributed under the

Free Scheme.

Animal husbandry is an activity which can
easily be taken up by rural communities, wherein
inputs are locally available and marketing of
livestock products does not pose major problem and
is functioning as a powerful instrument for the
comprehensive socio economic transformation of
the rural people. Further, it is acting as an engine
for growth and trigger rural economic improvement
through its multiplier effect. Animal Husbandry, in
short contributes significantly towards achieving the
goal of rural prosperity.

In order to prevent the general public from the
spread of Zoonotic diseases from Livestock an "One
Health Programme", will be initiated by the Animal
Husbandry and Health Departments. This initiative
will envisage sharing of technical skills, information
and implementation, so as to prevent the spread of
Zoonotic diseases and to control them effectively.

In view of such concerted and coordinated efforts

by both the Departments under the One Health
Programme, will certainly ensure not only the well

being of the general public and Livestock, but also
protect the environment in the long run.

**6. VETERINARY SERVICES**

Animal Husbandry Department provides timely
and effective health coverage to the livestock and
poultry population of the State for augmenting their
production and productivity. Veterinary services
are provided through the wide network of
Veterinary Institutions and Sub-centres located in
all the districts. The services provided include
health cover, disease diagnosis, disease prevention,
and disease control, breeding support and imparting
training to farmers. While Veterinary services are
provided by the professional work force, minor
veterinary services and first aid are provided
through Para veterinarians.

Artificial insemination of cattle using liquid
semen of exotic and graded breeds of cattle was
introduced by the Department of Animal Husbandry
during 1948. Further, with the introduction of
frozen semen during 1975, liquid semen was
gradually phased out and all the artificial
insemination centres started using frozen semen

from 1993.

Artificial Insemination horizontally
disseminates superior genetic resources in a
population within a short period. With this in mind,
to improve the milk production traits of cattle and
buffaloes, to bring more returns to the farmers and
to increase the State's milk production, artificial

3,479 Artificial Insemination Centres functioning
throughout the State. There are a total of
1,549 Artificial Insemination workers trained by
Tamil Nadu Livestock Development Agency
(TNLDA), through Tamil Nadu Veterinary and
Animal Sciences University (TANUVAS), engaged in
Artificial Insemination programme in the State
besides the above 3,479 Artificial Insemination

Centres.

The revised Breeding Policy of the State for
cattle which is in vogue since 2008–09 provides for
selective breeding of native breeds and for crossing
Non- descript cows with Jersey or Holstein Friesian
depending on agro climatic conditions. Wherever
crossing of Non-descript cows with Exotic
germplasm is practiced the level of exotic

inheritance should be restricted to 50%.

Back-crossing with exotic breeds should be avoided.
Indian breeds like Red Sindhi, Sahiwal and
Tharparkar may also be used for cross breeding the
Non-descript cows. Cross bred cows may be bred
with bulls having 50% Jersey or 50% Holstein
Friesian inheritance by inter-se mating.

Upgrading of Non-descript buffaloes with
Murrah and pure breeding of Toda buffaloes has
been advised in the breeding policy.
### 23


During 2014-15, 54.18 lakh Artificial
Insemination were performed by the Department
and 48.6% conception rate was achieved.

**6.1 VETERINARY INSTITUTIONS**

livestock diseases is a must, not only for profitable
livestock production but also essential to make our
livestock and livestock products globally acceptable.

Information about the prevalence rate and
disease pattern of the State's livestock population is
critical in the fight against livestock diseases and
this forms the basis for planning and initiating
disease prevention and control strategies. Early
forecasting of diseases and surveillance is essential
to provide early warning signals of outbreaks. Since
adequate awareness levels among farmers
regarding disease prevention and control is not
available, the Department plays a major role in
disease prevention and eradication. The
Department has a systematic Disease control
programme in place that provides for periodical
vaccinations (as per endemic chart) with the
eventual goal of disease containment and

eradication.

For this purpose, 22 Animal Disease
Intelligence Units (ADIUs), 2 Poultry Disease
Diagnostic Laboratories (PDDLs) and one Central
Referral Laboratory (CRL) are functioning in the

State.

**6.5.1 Animal Disease Intelligence Units**


diseases with a view to evolve strategic control
measures at District level. They map disease prone
areas by collecting epidemiological information and
data. This inturn helps in advising the field
veterinarians to take adequate protective and
prophylactic measures well in advance.

The Animal Disease Intelligence Units have an
important role in checking the efficiency of Foot and
Mouth Disease (FMD), Peste-des-Petits Ruminants
(PPR) vaccination by assessing the immunity level
through collecting the serum samples from
vaccinated animals and sending them to Central
Referral Laboratory, Saidapet and collecting serum
and samples of various diseases from simple
parasitic infestations to serious zoonotic diseases
like Brucellosis, Tuberculosis, Para Tuberculosis,
Avian Influenza, IBR, Anthrax and Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) for testing and

surveillance.

of dung samples, verminous mapping has been
undertaken by all ADIUs.

Animal Disease Intelligence Units also play a
crucial role in protecting the life of livestock besides
augmenting livestock production through regular
assessment of the quality of frozen semen straws,
profiling the blood parameters of livestock with
respect to micro and macro nutrients like Calcium,
Phosphorous, Potassium etc. so as to provide
advisories to the livestock rearers through
Veterinary Institutions for treatment of deficiency

diseases and metabolic disorders.

Mobile Veterinary Laboratories are provided to
these units, so as to provide on the spot microscope
aided diagnosis for livestock / poultry diseases. In
addition, these units render door to door diagnostic
services at village level and deliver vaccines and
biologicals without compromising the cold chain
through Mobile Veterinary Laboratories.

In order to protect Public health, monitoring
slaughter houses for hygienic practices, ensuring
preparedness with respect to diseases like Avian
Influenza, keeping vigil on the wet markets of
poultry, backyard and commercial farms of Poultry
and weekly visits of bird sanctuaries and water
bodies for any alarming levels of unusual mortality
of birds are some of the important activities
undertaken by these units. So far 3,657 serum

samples have been collected for this surveillance
work and 1,193 weekly visits were made by ADIUs
to slaughter houses.

(ILRs) for storage of biologicals and vaccines are
provided. Thus the Animal Disease Intelligence
Units are well equipped to diagnose various

livestock diseases in their laboratories.

During 2014-15, two New Animal Disease
Intelligence Units were established at

Thiruvannamalai and Pudukottai in order to

strengthen disease diagnosis, prevention, control
and monitoring.

**6.5.2 Poultry Disease Diagnostic Laboratories**

To cater the needs of farmers in areas of high
poultry production, Poultry Disease Diagnostic
Laboratories are functioning one at Andagalurgate,

Namakkal District and another at Erode. These are

mainly involved in conducting post-mortem, testing
of droppings, blood samples and other specimens
for accurate diagnosis of Viral diseases such as New
Castle Disease, Infectious Bursal Disease (IBD),
Infectious Bronchitis (IB), Avian Leucosis Complex,
common bacterial diseases like Salmonellosis,
E.coli, and Parasitic infestations. Feed and water
samples testing services are also provided by these
units. In addition, they offer technical advice to
farmers on prevention, diagnosis and control of
various infectious and parasitic diseases.

During 2014-15, a total number of
37,101 specimens have been tested by the above
units. Out of the 6,343 poultry droppings tested for
### 43


endoparasites, 3,141 were found positive,
deworming and anticoccidial drugs were advised
accordingly. 2,867 blood smears were examined,
out of which, 1,117 were positive for microorganisms and based on the Antibiotic Sensitivity
Test (ABST) specific antibiotics were advised.

A total of 6,643 samples were screened for the
presence of E.coli in droppings, feed, water and
poultry sheds, out of which 482 were found
positive. The farmers were advised to treat
accordingly with antibiotics and water sanitizers.
Based on test results, vaccination against Ranikhet

disease was also advised.

These laboratories play an important
preliminary role in the declaration of commercial
poultry farms as Avian Influenza free establishment
/ disease free compartments by monitoring the bio
security measures that have been put in place in
the poultry farms and maintenance of the status
thereafter.  Further, advisories regarding disease
prevention and control measures are being issued
to the farmers regularly.

Comprehensive field level monitoring and
testing of poultry farms with flock identification for
declaration of commercial poultry farms as disease
free establishment is carried out by PDDLs. This is

done for issuance of animal health certificates for

**7.1.7.1** **ASSISTANCE** **TO** **STATE** **POULTRY**
**FARMS (80:20)**

The department of Animal Husbandry is
implementing a centrally shared Scheme (80:20)
namely, 'Assistance to State Poultry Farms' in which
the Department-run poultry farms function as a
continuous source of backyard poultry chicks.

This scheme is being implemented to improve
the economic conditions and living standards of
marginal farmers, landless labourers, Self Help
Groups and other socially backward sections of the
society by encouraging them to take up poultry
rearing as an additional avocation, to create
employment opportunities and supplement their
income. Under this Scheme, separate hatchery
units have been established in poultry farms in
District livestock farms of Hosur, Chettinad and
Orathanadu for ‘Giriraja Development’ and one unit
in Kattupakkam Poultry Farm for Vanaraja
Development at a financial outlay of Rs.85 lakh.

Constructions of sheds have been completed
in Kattupakkam poultry farm for Turkey
Development and in District Livestock Farm,
Abishegapatti for Giriraja Development.

To purchase parent stock and feed from
revolving fund and procure equipments, a sum of
Rs.34 lakh has been allocated for Kattupakkam

**7.1.8** **Various** **Schemes** **implemented** **in**
**Departmental Farms**

**7.1.8.1 Fodder Development**

Community grazing areas and off-farm fodder
sources have been the important sources of fodder
for livestock. Urbanisation and continuous cropping
combined with the indiscriminate use of grazing
lands has resulted in pastures with very low
biomass production leading to adverse effect on
livestock production. To make dairying economically
attractive, milk production and productivity has to
be enhanced. This is possible only by ensuring that
good quality feed and fodder is made available in
adequate quantities. Therefore, efforts have to be
initiated to improve fodder production and
conservation of agricultural lands for fodder. Since
more areas are brought under food crops cultivation
to meet the food demand for human consumption,
increasing the production capacity of the existing
fodder cultivable lands will be the only beneficial

solution.

A crucial aspect of fodder development is
availability of seed and planting material. Quality
fodder seeds are not readily available. To overcome
### 60


-----

this deficit, the departmental farms are also
functioning as fodder seed banks producing and
supplying seeds and planting material to farmers.
Government has taken initiatives to encourage
farmers for taking up production of high yielding
fodder varieties through various State and Central

schemes.

Apart from this, the Department is undertaking
the following fodder development activities:
### � To  enable the landless families and poor

farmers to take up animal husbandry activities,
Self-help groups are being encouraged for
establishment of community feed and fodder

banks. � Cultivation of perennial high yielding fodder

grass like Cumbu-Napier- Co3, Co4, Para
grass, Kolukattai grass, Guinea grass and
Congo signal grass and fodder cereals like
Sorghum, Maize and Bajra are being
encouraged. � Cultivation of Fodder crops and Tree seedling

in Veterinary Institutions are being taken up. � Fodder, Fodder slips and fodder seeds are

produced in Departmental Farms and

distributed to farmers. 61

**8.2.1.3 Establishment of Broiler Farm**

Broiler Chicken rearing can be undertaken
through integration wherein, integrators supply day
old chicks and feed required for the birds. The
integrators also ensure that the birds are marketed
through their own channels. A broiler farm with
strength of upto 5,000 birds can be profitably run
using family labour alone and thus negates the
requirement of additional man power.

For the year 2012-13, Broiler units were

established in 7 Districts around Sankarankoil and

Villupuram regions of the State. Sankarankoil
Region includes suitable areas in Tirunelveli,
Thoothukudi and Virudhunagar Districts. Likewise,
Villupuram Region includes suitable areas in
Villupuram, Cuddalore, Ariyalur and Perambalur
Districts. During the year 2013-14, in addition to
these Districts, this scheme has been extended to

250 / 500 birds can be profitably reared and
marketed by the farmer himself. The beneficiary is
encouraged to have tie up with Native Chicken
Breeders / Hatchery units for regular supply of
chicks at mutually agreed prices and the beneficiary
himself can do the rearing and marketing since
Native Chicken meat and eggs have a better market
throughout the State.

The green fodder resources for livestock are
from grass lands, pastures, fodder crops, weeds,
bund grasses, tree leaves and mixed forages. Rapid
urbanization with the increase in requirement of
land for growing food crops have resulted in
shrinking of grazing lands which in turn increased
the gap between demand and availability of green
fodder. Hence it is essential to enhance the green
fodder production by adopting better scientific
management of Agricultural lands and common

property resources.

With the above objective, Government is
implementing State Fodder Development Scheme
since 2011-12. From 2011-12 to 2013-14, a sum of

Rs.65 crore was sanctioned and 52000 acres of

farmers' land were brought under green fodder
cultivation. Through this development, 86.4 LMT of
green fodder has been produced. Besides this to
enhance green fodder production and to avoid
wastage of green fodder fed to animals
4,957 Rainguns and 4,178 power operated Chaff
cutters were distributed to farmers at 75% subsidy.
To facilitate easy and uniform harvest of fodder,
2,500 grass cutters were distributed to the farmers
at 50% subsidy. In order to enlighten the
importance of feeding tree fodder to the animals,
30 lakh Agathi tree seedlings were distributed to

the farmers at free of cost.
### 79


**8.3.1 STATE FODDER DEVELOPMENT SCHEME**

To ensure the continuous availability of fodder,
a sum of Rs.25 crore was allotted during 2014 -15
towards implemetation of State Fodder

condition at an outlay of Rs.6.40 crore. Farmers
were provided with a sum of Rs.2000 as 100%
subsidy per unit of 0.25 acres towards procurement
of slips and fertilizers.

**2.** **Cultivation of sorghum and cowpea under**

**rainfed cultivation**

Farmers' holdings of 40,000 acres were
brought under fodder sorghum and fodder cowpea
cultivation under rain fed condition at an outlay of

Rs.8.80 crore.

**3.** **Distribution of Agathi seeds to farmers**

To sensitize the farmers about the importance
of feeding tree fodder to the animals, farmers are

were brought under Agathi tree plantation at an
outlay of Rs.80 lakh.

**4.Installation of rain guns**

To utilize the available water efficiently and
enhance green fodder production, 2440 acres of
farmers’ land were brought under raingun system of
irrigation across the State at an outlay of Rs.4.575
crore . Each beneficiary has been provided with a
sum of Rs.18,750 as 75% subsidy for installation of
rain gun in an acre.

**5.Propagation of Azolla :**
Azolla is a water plant which is a high quality
fodder rich in protein, can be substituted for green
fodder and produced at a cheaper cost. At a total
outlay of Rs.1.60 crore, 10,000 Azolla units have

been established across the State. Farmers are

provided with 100% assistance of
Rs.1600/unit/farmer.

**8.3.2 ESTABLISHMENT OF FODDER PRODUCTION**

**UNITS IN MEIKKAL POROMBOKE LAND**

A large majority of the farming community in
our State are small and marginal farmers with
limited land holdings. These farmers traditionally
rely on common lands and other common resources
to meet out a significant portion of the fodder
requirements for their livestock. Common lands are
therefore a critical livelihood resource for landless,

priority need to rejuvenate the common land
(grazing land) into green fodder production unit.

During 2014 -15, for establishment of Fodder
Production unit in meikkal land,on a pilot mode,
83.5 acres of Meikkal Land at Keelveedi village in

Vellore and 61 acres of Meikkal Land at Panthadu

and Nagalpakkam village in Villupuram districts
were identified by Tamil Nadu Veterinary and
Animal Sciences University and Animal Husbandry
Department with the help of District Administration.
The activities like levelling, field demarcation, laying
chain link fencing with RCC pillars, minor works,
sinking of bore wells, construction of pump rooms
with pump sets, construction of silage tower, laying
of pipelines and installation of sprinkler are being
taken up through Rural Development Department at
a cost of Rs.3.78 crore. For procurement of
Agricultural machineries and inputs for cultivation of
fodder, Rs.2.62 crore has been provided through
the Animal Husbandry Department. This scheme will
be implemented through Tamil Nadu Veterinary and
Animal Sciences University. Through this scheme, it
is envisaged to produce 4320 MT of green fodder
throughout the year. After maintaining for 5 years,

the Fodder bank will be handed over to the local

panchayat for further maintenance. The total
financial outlay of the Scheme is Rs.6.95 crore.

**PROGRAMME**

Foot and Mouth disease is a highly contagious,
viral, vesicular disease of cloven-footed animals. It

causes severe blisters inside the mouth and on the

feet that may rupture and lead to severe ulcers. It
results in heavy economic loss due to reduction in
milk production, infertility and high mortality in

calves. Its containment demands considerable

efforts in vaccination, strict monitoring, trade
restrictions and quarantines. To control this
disease, Extended Foot and Mouth Disease Control
Programme funded by Government of India is
implemented in all Districts of Tamil Nadu. So far,

8 rounds of FMD vaccination have been carried out

in all the Districts of the State. During 2014-15,

**8.5.8. VETERINARY PUBLIC HEALTH**

Zoonotic diseases are diseases caused by
infectious agents that can be transmitted between
animals and humans. Controlling zoonoses is
particularly important in developing countries.
Animal husbandry plays important role in
maintaining health of the general public in terms of
prevention of zoonotic diseases. With animal
husbandry forming the core livelihood of millions of
rural population, veterinary public health plays a
vital role in controlling the zoonotic diseases.

**8.5.8.1 Canine Rabies Control Programme:**

Rabies in Human beings and animals is
considered as a major public health problem in
most of the States in India including Tamil Nadu.
Dogs transmit Rabies disease not only to human
beings but also to various other livestock which are
of great economic importance to the stake holders.
Thus, elimination of canine rabies constitutes the
most effective means of controlling transmission to
human beings and other livestock.

With above objective, Canine Rabies Control
Programme Unit is functioning at Madurai and

Tirunelveli. The main functions of these units are:

� Systematic, periodical door-to-door
prophylactic vaccination of pet dogs against
rabies is provided.
### 109


� Post exposure vaccination of all livestock
including dogs is provided free of cost

� Creation of awareness among the public
through publicity and propaganda by
distributing pamphlets and handbills and by
conducting dog shows.

During 2014-15, a total number of 6,498 pet
dogs were vaccinated in the above centres.

**8.5.9 INTENSIVE HEALTH COVER PROGRAMME**

**FOR SHEEP / GOATS**

Sheep / goats are reared mainly by grazing,
thus making them highly vulnerable to
endoparasitism which results in weight loss, delayed
maturity, high mortality rate, low fertility rate etc.,
apart from making them susceptible to other
diseases. This also affects the quality of meat and
carcass yield.

Sheep / goats have to be dewormed
periodically to avoid the above adverse impact. In
this regard, the department is implementing
Intensive Health Cover Programme for sheep /
goats since the year 1982-83. Under this
Programme, the sheep / goats maintained by poor
farmers in all the Districts except Chennai, are
dewormed once in 3 months at their doorsteps.
During the year 2013-14, the Programme was
### 110

important diseases causing heavy mortality in
poultry. The Department is providing vaccination
against this disease on specified days at all the
veterinary institutions and sub centres every week
and also in the camps conducted under 'Kalnadai
Padhukappu Thittam' to protect the poultry from
this disease. Apart from this, the Department also
conducts State wide vaccination drive against
Ranikhet disease during the month of February

**b.** **Embryo transfer programme in Cattle**

Embryo Transfer Technology (ETT) is a tool to
realise the potential of genetically superior cow to
the maximum by producing more number of calves
from each cow within a short period of time to
### 155


achieve the genetic improvement of the herd at a
faster rate than through Artificial Insemination. This
technology is also useful for conservation of
indigenous breeds.

A cow may produce 5-10 calves in a period of
10 to 15 years through the artificial insemination
breeding programme. An elite cow is made to
produce 5 to 15 ova in one oestrous cycle, through
harmonal treatment. By breeding this super
ovulated cow with the semen of a superior bull,
multiple embryos are produced. The embryos are
then collected by non-surgical method, evaluated
and transferred to the recipient cows. The embryos

of the cow can also be frozen and stored for

subsequent use. The frozen embryos can be thawed
and transferred to recipient cows. Thus, up to
50 calves may be produced from one cow through
the Embryo Transfer Technology (ETT) in a short
period of 1-2 years. These recipient cows are
diagnosed for pregnancy after 60 days. Pregnant
recipient cows are given additional concentrate feed
in the last trimester of pregnancy.

The bull calves born through this technology
are purchased at the rate of Rs.5000 per calf and

the heifer calves are left with the farmers.

the insurance of animals among the public and to

attract more number of beneficiaries towards the

scheme, pamphlets illustrating the importance of
### 161


the scheme and folders which exemplify the
various diseases affecting cattle and the
significance of insurance of those animals are being
distributed in the camps, exhibitions etc., banners
are being placed where farmers assemble like
District Collector’s campus, Veterinary
Dispensaries, Veterinary Hospitals, Clinician
Centres, Polyclinics, Sub-centres, Co-operative
milk societies, etc. A documentary film was
produced illustrating the importance of Livestock
Insurance scheme, which has been screened
during various camps like Kalnadai Padukappu
Thittam, Mass contact programme, Infertility
camp, Veterinary University Training and Research
centre camps, various exhibitions, etc., Besides
these, necessary steps have been taken to
advertise the scheme through medias like radio,

**15. CONCLUSION**

Rural economic improvement through
initiatives in Animal Husbandry sector has been
given special impetus by this Government.
Livestock Policy through appropriate programmes
and investments helped in achieving substantially
higher growth rate for milk, meat and egg products.
This has made available the required quantity of
much needed animal protein to the rural poor.
Further, the sector has tremendous potential to
generate employment, provide nutritional security,
enhanced household income through increased
productivity and thus help in poverty reduction
among the rural poor and transformation of rural
scenario. It is acting as an engine in poverty
alleviation by making assetless poor into income
generating asset owning population.

Women targeted welfare programmes like
Free Distribution of Milch Cows and Sheep / Goat
have empowered rural women in the context of
economic freedom. Moreover, additional production
of milk, not only leads to the radiant second White
Revolution as envisaged, but also ensures
substantial household income to the rural poor

women.
### 195


An inclusive approach for development by
making socially and economically weaker sections of
the society as important stakeholders in the
decision making process has ensured equity and
balanced livelihood perspective.

This Department is not only augmenting food
security, empowerment of rural women and rural
youth, but also helps in triggering and invigorating
the rural economy, ultimately contributing
significantly to the comprehensive socio economic

transformation of the rural areas in the State and

thus progressing towards achieving the goals as
envisaged in the Vision 2023 document.
