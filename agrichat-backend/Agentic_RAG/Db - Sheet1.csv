Farming,Punjab,Ropar,Rabi,H,,Can we do farming with Ocean water?,,"Aug 5, 2025","Farming with ocean water, known as seawater or saline agriculture, is possible but comes with challenges. Most crops cannot tolerate high salt levels, so traditional farming is not feasible. However, certain halophytes (salt-tolerant plants) like Salicornia, quinoa, and mangroves can grow in saline conditions and are being explored for food, fodder, and biofuel. Techniques such as desalination, mixing seawater with freshwater, or using hydroponics with partial seawater can also support some crops. Research is ongoing to develop salt-resistant varieties. While promising in coastal and arid regions, seawater farming still requires careful management and infrastructure investment."
