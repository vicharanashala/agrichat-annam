Leaf blight in potatoes refers to several diseases, most notably early blight and late blight.

**Early Blight:**

*   **Cause:**  The fungus *Alternaria solani*.
*   **Symptoms:**  Begins as small, dark, dry spots on older leaves, developing into brown-black, circular-to-oval areas with a target-like appearance due to concentric rings.  Yellowing and death of leaves follow.  Tubers develop dark, circular spots with raised, purple edges; the flesh beneath is brown, dry, and leathery.
*   **Prevention:** Use resistant varieties (late-maturing varieties tend to be more resistant), maintain plant health, avoid overhead irrigation, rotate crops (at least 225-450 yards from previous potato or tomato fields), use a border crop like wheat, and manage nitrogen and phosphorus levels. Chemical control measures may also be necessary.

**Late Blight:**

*   **Cause:** The fungus *Phytophthora infestans*.
*   **Symptoms:** Leaf spots start as small, pale to dark green, irregularly shaped spots, often with pale green or yellow rings. Spots rapidly enlarge in cool, moist weather, turning brown to purplish-black.  A white fungal growth may appear on the undersides of leaves.  Tubers develop brown to purplish skin lesions; the flesh shows a tan-brown, dry, granular rot.
*   **Prevention:** Use disease-free seed potatoes, keep cull piles away from growing areas, destroy volunteer plants, keep tubers covered with soil, remove infected tubers before storage, and kill vines before harvest. Resistant varieties are available, but fungicides may still be needed.

To properly store potatoes and extend their shelf life, follow these guidelines:

### Potato Storage Guidelines

*   **Choose a Cool, Dark Place:** Store potatoes in an area that is cool, dry, and dark. Ideal temperatures are around 50°F (10°C), similar to a pantry cabinet or a cool basement. Avoid storing them on countertops where they are exposed to light (food52.com).
*   **Ensure Good Airflow:** Potatoes need ventilation to prevent moisture buildup, which can lead to spoilage.
    *   Transfer potatoes from their original plastic packaging to a paper bag, mesh bag, or a well-ventilated container (food52.com).
    *   If keeping them in the original plastic bag, ensure it is perforated and not tightly sealed (food52.com).
*   **Avoid Sunlight:** Direct sunlight can cause potatoes to turn green, wrinkle, and rot due to photosynthesis. Keep them in a drawer, basket, closet, or paper bag (food52.com). Green potatoes can develop a bitter flavor and may be irritating to the digestive system (food52.com).
*   **Do Not Refrigerate:** Storing potatoes in the refrigerator is not recommended. Cold temperatures cause the starch to convert into sugars, leading to a sweeter taste and an unappetizing brown color when cooked (food52.com, citing Harold McGee in *On Food and Cooking*",FallbackAgriTool_called

To grow strawberries successfully, consider the following steps:

### 1. Choose the Right Strawberry Type

There are three main types of strawberries, each with a different fruiting habit:
*   **June-bearing strawberries:** Produce a large, concentrated crop in mid-June to early July. They typically yield the largest crop per season but in a short period. (University of Minnesota Extension)
*   **Ever-bearing strawberries:** Produce two crops, one in early summer and a second in early fall. (University of Minnesota Extension)
*   **Day-neutral strawberries:** Produce fruit throughout most of the growing season until the first frost. (University of Minnesota Extension, Bonnie Plants)

### 2. Site Selection and Soil Preparation

*   **Sunlight:** Strawberries need full sun to produce maximum fruit, ideally 10 or more hours of direct sunlight daily, but a minimum of six hours is essential. Choose a site away from trees and buildings that cast shade. (University of Minnesota Extension, Bonnie Plants)
*   **Soil:** Strawberries prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH between 5.5 and 6.8. Good drainage is crucial; avoid areas where water accumulates. (University of Minnesota Extension, Bonnie Plants)
*   **Soil Amendment:** Before planting, work several inches of well-rotted compost or other rich organic matter into the soil. This adds nutrients, improves drainage, and enhances microbial activity. If you have heavy clay soil, rake it into raised mounds to further improve drainage. For sandy soil, mix in a 1-inch layer of rich compost or rotted manure. (University of Minnesota Extension, Bonnie Plants)
*   **Soil Test:** Consider a soil test to determine if any specific nutrients are needed. (University of Minnesota Extension)

### 3. Planting Strawberries

*   **When to Plant:**
    *   **Northern Zones (USDA Zone 6 northward):** Best planted in spring so they are well-rooted by winter. (Bonnie Plants)
    *   **Southern Zones (USDA Zone 7 southward):** Can be planted in fall. (Bonnie Plants)
    *   **Transplants:** Plant dormant bare-root transplants in spring when the soil is warm enough. Potted plants should be planted soon after purchase, once the risk of frost has passed. (University of Minnesota Extension)
*   **Buying Plants:** Nurseries often ship dormant, bare-root plants. Keep them moist and cool, and plant as soon as possible. If buying potted plants, look for vigorous plants without discolored or dead leaves. (University of Minnesota Extension)
*   **Planting Depth:** This is critical.",FallbackAgriTool_called
