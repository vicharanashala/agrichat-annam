Leaf blight in potatoes refers to several diseases, most notably early blight and late blight.

**Early Blight:**

*   **Cause:**  The fungus *Alternaria solani*.
*   **Symptoms:**  Begins as small, dark, dry spots on older leaves, developing into brown-black, circular-to-oval areas with a target-like appearance due to concentric rings.  Yellowing and death of leaves follow.  Tubers develop dark, circular spots with raised, purple edges; the flesh beneath is brown, dry, and leathery.
*   **Prevention:** Use resistant varieties (late-maturing varieties tend to be more resistant), maintain plant health, avoid overhead irrigation, rotate crops (at least 225-450 yards from previous potato or tomato fields), use a border crop like wheat, and manage nitrogen and phosphorus levels. Chemical control measures may also be necessary.

**Late Blight:**

*   **Cause:** The fungus *Phytophthora infestans*.
*   **Symptoms:** Leaf spots start as small, pale to dark green, irregularly shaped spots, often with pale green or yellow rings. Spots rapidly enlarge in cool, moist weather, turning brown to purplish-black.  A white fungal growth may appear on the undersides of leaves.  Tubers develop brown to purplish skin lesions; the flesh shows a tan-brown, dry, granular rot.
*   **Prevention:** Use disease-free seed potatoes, keep cull piles away from growing areas, destroy volunteer plants, keep tubers covered with soil, remove infected tubers before storage, and kill vines before harvest. Resistant varieties are available, but fungicides may still be needed.

To properly store potatoes and extend their shelf life, follow these guidelines:

### Potato Storage Guidelines

*   **Choose a Cool, Dark Place:** Store potatoes in an area that is cool, dry, and dark. Ideal temperatures are around 50°F (10°C), similar to a pantry cabinet or a cool basement. Avoid storing them on countertops where they are exposed to light (food52.com).
*   **Ensure Good Airflow:** Potatoes need ventilation to prevent moisture buildup, which can lead to spoilage.
    *   Transfer potatoes from their original plastic packaging to a paper bag, mesh bag, or a well-ventilated container (food52.com).
    *   If keeping them in the original plastic bag, ensure it is perforated and not tightly sealed (food52.com).
*   **Avoid Sunlight:** Direct sunlight can cause potatoes to turn green, wrinkle, and rot due to photosynthesis. Keep them in a drawer, basket, closet, or paper bag (food52.com). Green potatoes can develop a bitter flavor and may be irritating to the digestive system (food52.com).
*   **Do Not Refrigerate:** Storing potatoes in the refrigerator is not recommended. Cold temperatures cause the starch to convert into sugars, leading to a sweeter taste and an unappetizing brown color when cooked (food52.com, citing Harold McGee in *On Food and Cooking*",FallbackAgriTool_called
