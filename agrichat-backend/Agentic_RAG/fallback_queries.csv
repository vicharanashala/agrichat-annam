Leaf blight in potatoes refers to several diseases, most notably early blight and late blight.

**Early Blight:**

*   **Cause:**  The fungus *Alternaria solani*.
*   **Symptoms:**  Begins as small, dark, dry spots on older leaves, developing into brown-black, circular-to-oval areas with a target-like appearance due to concentric rings.  Yellowing and death of leaves follow.  Tubers develop dark, circular spots with raised, purple edges; the flesh beneath is brown, dry, and leathery.
*   **Prevention:** Use resistant varieties (late-maturing varieties tend to be more resistant), maintain plant health, avoid overhead irrigation, rotate crops (at least 225-450 yards from previous potato or tomato fields), use a border crop like wheat, and manage nitrogen and phosphorus levels. Chemical control measures may also be necessary.

**Late Blight:**

*   **Cause:** The fungus *Phytophthora infestans*.
*   **Symptoms:** Leaf spots start as small, pale to dark green, irregularly shaped spots, often with pale green or yellow rings. Spots rapidly enlarge in cool, moist weather, turning brown to purplish-black.  A white fungal growth may appear on the undersides of leaves.  Tubers develop brown to purplish skin lesions; the flesh shows a tan-brown, dry, granular rot.
*   **Prevention:** Use disease-free seed potatoes, keep cull piles away from growing areas, destroy volunteer plants, keep tubers covered with soil, remove infected tubers before storage, and kill vines before harvest. Resistant varieties are available, but fungicides may still be needed.

# Potato Blight

**Late Blight:**

*   **Causative Agent:**  _Phytophthora infestans_ (fungus-like oomycete)
*   **Symptoms:** Watery rot of leaves, rapid spread, leaf collapse and browning, brown lesions on stems, reddish-brown decay on tubers (firm initially, then soft rot), white fungal growth on leaf undersides in humid conditions.  The RHS provides images illustrating these symptoms. [https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/plant-problems/potato-blight](https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/plant-problems/potato-blight)
*   **Control:**
    *   **Non-chemical:** Deep burial or burning of infected material (do not compost), thorough earthing up of potatoes, early harvest, blight forecasts (BlightSpy: [https://ahdb.org.uk/blightspy](https://ahdb.org.uk/blightspy)), removal of infected leaves/leaflets (limited effectiveness), haulm destruction before harvest, crop rotation (at least four years), destruction of all potatoes and waste before spring.  Consider resistant varieties like Athlete, Alouette, Carolus, and Sarpo cultivars.  The British Potato Variety Database ([http://varieties.ahdb.org.uk/](http://varieties.ahdb.org.uk/)) and Euroblight ([https://agro.au.dk/forskning/internationale-platforme/euroblight/](https://agro.au.dk/forskning/internationale-platforme/euroblight/)) offer further information on resistant varieties and blight strains.
    *   **Chemical:** No fungicides currently available for home gardeners.
*   **Biology:** Spores spread by wind, require prolonged wetness for infection, rapid spread through plant tissues, overwinters in infected tubers, potential for oospore production (resting spores) which may survive composting.

**Early Blight:**

*   **Causative Agent:** _Alternaria solani_ and _A. alternata_ (fungi)
*   **Symptoms:** Small, dark, dry leaf flecks developing into brown-black, circular-to-oval spots with concentric rings (""target spot""), yellowing and death of leaves (starting with lower leaves), dark spots on stems, dark circular spots on tubers with brown, dry, leathery rot inside.  UConn provides detailed descriptions and images of early blight symptoms. [https://ipm.cahnr.uconn.edu/a-z-index](https://ipm.cahnr.uconn.edu/a-z-index)
*   **Control:** Resistant varieties (late-maturing varieties generally more resistant), healthy plant maintenance, avoid overhead irrigation, proper tuber maturity before digging, crop rotation (avoid potatoes or tomatoes in previous year's field), field separation from previous year's field (225-450 yards), border crops (wheat), balanced fertilization (adequate nitrogen, low phosphorus).  Chemical control measures are also mentioned but require current recommendations.
