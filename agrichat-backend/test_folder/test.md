Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to answer this user's question about Mobile Veterinary Units. 

First, looking at the context provided. It mentions that Mobile Veterinary Units are functions of a Department serving rural livestock in remote areas. They deliver veterinary health services door-to-door.

The user asked for an explanation of what these units are. So I need to make sure my answer is accurate and concise. Let me break it down:

1. **Department**: I should specify the Department, probably State because there's mention of 56 Mobile Units in the context.
2. **Function**: They deliver health care and veterinary services.
3. **Area**: They target farmers in remote areas who don't have access to formal healthcare.
4. **Tools/Methods**: The user might also want details about how many animals they provide treatment for or any specific activities like Arcs (which were previously seen). In this case, the data doesn't mention Arcs; the units provided livestock but didn't perform arc procedure before. So maybe I can note that absence.

I need to structure my answer clearly so it's easy to understand. Making sure each point is mentioned when necessary and covering all key points from the context.

Wait, let me double-check. The user added a table at the end which says 0.92 lakh Artificial Inseminations are performed by Mobile Units in 2014-15. Those numbers show they do routine procedures but don't provide arc services again before. So I should include that in my answer to show their operations.

Putting it all together, the response should cover what these units do, the specific Department, their target audience (farmers), the context of mobile vs formal care, the number of animals handled, and whether they do any arc procedures after handing over vehicles before delivering treatment.
