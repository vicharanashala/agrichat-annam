This is a Gradio-based web interface for **automatic language detection and transcription** of audio files using two powerful models:
- [`openai/whisper-large`](https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large) for language detection
- [`ai4bharat/indic-conformer-600m-multilingual`](https://huggingface.co/ai4bharat/indic-conformer-600m-multilingual) for multilingual speech transcription using both CTC and RNNT decoders.
