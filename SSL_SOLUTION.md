## Solution for ngrok SSL Certificate Errors

### Problem
ngrok's free tier without authentication uses self-signed certificates that browsers don't trust, causing `ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID` errors.

### Solutions (in order of preference):

### 1. Use ngrok with Authentication (Best Solution)
1. Go to https://ngrok.com/signup (free account)
2. Get your authtoken from the dashboard
3. Run: `ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_TOKEN`
4. Restart ngrok: `ngrok http 8000`
5. This provides better SSL certificates that browsers trust

### 2. Use HTTP endpoint (Current Workaround)
- Update config.js to use: `http://your-ngrok-id.ngrok.io/api`
- However, this may cause mixed content issues (HTTPS Vercel → HTTP ngrok)

### 3. Configure CORS and SSL properly
- Ensure your backend accepts the ngrok HTTPS requests
- Add proper CORS headers for the ngrok domain

### 4. Alternative: Use a different tunneling service
- Cloudflare Tunnel (free, better SSL)
- LocalTunnel
- Pagekite

### Current Status
- Backend: HTTP on localhost:8000 ✅
- ngrok: Providing HTTPS tunnel ⚠️ (SSL issues)
- Frontend: HTTPS on Vercel ✅
- Issue: SSL certificate validation failures

### Recommended Action
Sign up for free ngrok account and add authtoken for better SSL certificates.
