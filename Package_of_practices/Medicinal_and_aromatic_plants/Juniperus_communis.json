Hence, to multiply the plant through vegetative propagation is preferable. Stem cutting is suitable in May. Apical shoot (15cm) performs better root formation than the older part of the stem. Sand is most suitable medium for planting. In propagation chamber or polytunnel, the success rate of rooting is 40 to 57%. IBA 2500 ppm promotes rooting in maximum cuttings (80%) followed by IBA 3000 ppm (60%). Peeling of bark at the lower end of the cuttings improves the rate of success as compared to round or normal cut and crushing at the lower end. Normally, stem-cuttings take 60–70 days for rooting. The rooted stemcuttings should be hardened at least for 6 months before transplanting in field. In nursery, the stem-cuttings should be planted at 10cm X10cm spacing."
