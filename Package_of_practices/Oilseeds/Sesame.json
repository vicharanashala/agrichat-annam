The average yield of sesame (413 kg/ha) in India is low as compared with other countries in the world (535 kg / ha). The main reasons for low productivity of sesame are its rainfed cultivation in marginal and submarginal lands under poor management and input starved conditions. However, improved varieties and agro production technologies capable of increasing the productivity levels of sesame are now developed for different agro ecological situations in the country. A well managed crop of sesame can yield 1200–1500 kg/ha under irrigated and 800–1000 kg/ha under rainfed conditions."

Sesame plant needs fairly high temperature during its life cycle. Normally the optimum temperature required during its life cycle is between 25–35 degree C. If the temperature is more than 40 degree C with hot winds the oil content reduces. If the temperature goes beyond 45 degree C or less than 15 degree C there is a severe reduction in yield."
