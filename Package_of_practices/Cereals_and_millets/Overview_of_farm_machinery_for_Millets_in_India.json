These are nutri cereals comprising of sorghum, pearl millet, finger millet (major millets), foxtail millet, little millet, kodo millet, proso millet and barnyard millet (minor millets). These are one of the oldest food known to humanity. These are one of the several species of coarse cereal grasses in the family Poaceae, cultivated for their small edible seeds. These are highly nutritious, non-glutinous and not acid forming foods. Hence they are soothing and easy to digest."

The inflorescences may be spikes or racemes, in which the flowers are borne on stalks of about equal length along an elongated axis, or panicles with dense clusters of small florets. With the exception of pearl millet, seeds remain enclosed in hulls after threshing. Hulled seeds are usually creamy white."
