No other crop is as versatile as rice. Rice crop is interwoven in the cultural, social and economic life of millions of Indian and it holds the key for food and nutritional security of the country. Rice production scenario in the country during the past decade presents a gloomy picture of compound growth rate of just 1.7 per cent. To meet a production target of 125 million tonnes by 2025, all inclusive of food requirement, seed for cultivation, storage in buffer stock and a share for exports, productivity in irrigated area needs to be enhanced by 1.5 tons/ha and in rain-fed lowlands by about 1 ton/ha."
