India contributes about 16% of the world’s sorghum production. It is the fourth most important cereal crop in the country and also contributing green fodder, feed and biofuel."

        "content": "This crop was one of the major cereal during the 1950s contributing to more than 10% of the food basket. At present, it is reduced to less than 4.0%. Sorghum cultivation is taken up in 5.97 m ha with a production of 5.01 million tonnes ( Ref : Agricultural Statistics at a Glance 2018°f Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare ). There has been rapid improvement in productivity - 466 kg/ ha in 1971 as against 998 kg/ ha in 2017–18. This has been possible through use of productive hybrids and varieties and adoption of improved production technologies. In the last three decades productivity has gone upto 84% in case of kharif sorghum and 70% in rabi sorghum."
