**1. INTRODUCTION**

Animal Husbandry sector plays a vital role in
sustaining rural livelihoods and improving the
economy of rural population. Livestock sector
provides productive employment especially self
employment and guaranteed supplementary
household income to a majority of rural households
particularly small and marginal farmers besides
providing nutritious food products like milk, meat
and eggs. The live animals are important natural
assets for the poor, which can be easily liquidated
### 1


for cash during emergency. Livestock have
remained an integral part of the socio-economic
fabric of rural people since time immemorial, not
only as a source of livelihood but also as a provider
of draught energy, manure and fuel.

Sustained rise in income and urbanization are

now fuelling rapid growth in demand for animal food
products and the livestock are coming under
pressure to produce more. Over the last three
decades livestock production grew faster than crop
sector as a whole and has made significant
contributions to agricultural growth, which is
considered to be an important factor in poverty
reduction among rural people.

Livestock Revolution is also significantly
contributing towards improving nutritional security
and reducing rural poverty. The rural poor have
little access to agriculture land and thus there are
limited opportunities for them in crop production.
On the other hand, livestock wealth is equitably
distributed compared to land, and generates
opportunities for the poor to escape poverty
through livestock production.

The contribution of livestock sector to the

Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) is
4.31% and that to the agriculture and allied
activities is 41.84% (Advanced Estimate at Current
Prices). During 2006-07, the gross value of
### 2

output of livestock, which was 11,535.23 crore in
the State has increased to Rs.55,068.20 crore
during 2014-15 (Advanced Estimate at Current
Prices). The estimated milk production, which was
54.74 lakh Metric Tonnes during 2005-06 in Tamil
Nadu, has increased to 71.32 lakh Metric Tonnes
during 2014-15. Likewise, the estimated egg
production, which was 62,225 lakh numbers during
2005-06 has increased to 1,59,253 lakh numbers
during 2014-15.

The per capita availability of milk per day and
eggs per annum has increased from 231 gms and
100 numbers during 2005-06 to 257 gms and
209 numbers during 2014-15 respectively. Apart
from these, the estimated meat production
(including poultry meat), which was 1,186 lakh kgs
during 2005-06 has increased to 4,919 lakh kgs
during 2014-15. The State contributes 5.12% of
milk production, 19.23% of egg production and
7.45% of total meat production (including poultry
meat) and ranked 10 [th] in milk production, 1 [st] in egg
production and 6 [th] in meat production in the country
during 2014-15.

The Animal Husbandry Department plays a
major role in implementing various programmes
effectively and providing veterinary assistance,
health care and breeding services to the livestock
and poultry reared by the farmers in the State
### 3


through a network of 2,679 Veterinary Institutions
and 800 Veterinary Sub-Centres. Further, Mobile
Veterinary Units also provide veterinary services to
the livestock of the farmers residing in remote
areas at their doorsteps. This timely services results
in increased production of livestock products like
milk, meat and egg.

The State Government is also successfully
progressing towards its objective of increasing the
milk production in order to achieve a ‘Second White

Revolution’ in the State. Hon’ble Chief Minister’s

“Tamil Nadu Vision 2023” envisages making Tamil
Nadu the 'Numero Uno' State by achieving a target
of 11 per cent growth in Gross State Domestic
Product (GSDP), for which contribution of primary
sectors like Agriculture and its allied sectors like
Animal Husbandry is inevitable.

The Hon'ble Chief Minister has given special
emphasis to the Animal Husbandry sector, for
ensuring the welfare of the rural poor. “Free

distribution of Milch Cows and Free distribution of

Goats / Sheep” to poor women in rural areas were
launched by Hon’ble Chief Minister. These schemes
aim at achieving the twin objectives of economic
improvement of rural women by empowering them
with sustainable income generating livestock and to

usher in a radiant white revolution in the State.

Since the inception of the scheme during
### 4


-----

2011-12 till 2014-15, 22 lakh goats /sheep and

48 thousand milch cows have been distributed to

poor needy families. These animals have given birth
to  31.14 lakh kids and 47,971 calves respectively.
Further, 1.70 lakh litres of milk is being produced
every day from the milch cows distributed under the

Free Scheme.

Animal husbandry is an activity which can
easily be taken up by rural communities, wherein
inputs are locally available and marketing of
livestock products does not pose major problem and
is functioning as a powerful instrument for the
comprehensive socio economic transformation of
the rural people. Further, it is acting as an engine
for growth and trigger rural economic improvement
through its multiplier effect. Animal Husbandry, in
short contributes significantly towards achieving the
goal of rural prosperity.

In order to prevent the general public from the
spread of Zoonotic diseases from Livestock an "One
Health Programme", will be initiated by the Animal
Husbandry and Health Departments. This initiative
will envisage sharing of technical skills, information
and implementation, so as to prevent the spread of
Zoonotic diseases and to control them effectively.

In view of such concerted and coordinated efforts

by both the Departments under the One Health
Programme, will certainly ensure not only the well

being of the general public and Livestock, but also
protect the environment in the long run.

**6. VETERINARY SERVICES**

Animal Husbandry Department provides timely
and effective health coverage to the livestock and
poultry population of the State for augmenting their
production and productivity. Veterinary services
are provided through the wide network of
Veterinary Institutions and Sub-centres located in
all the districts. The services provided include
health cover, disease diagnosis, disease prevention,
and disease control, breeding support and imparting
training to farmers. While Veterinary services are
provided by the professional work force, minor
veterinary services and first aid are provided
through Para veterinarians.

Artificial insemination of cattle using liquid
semen of exotic and graded breeds of cattle was
introduced by the Department of Animal Husbandry
during 1948. Further, with the introduction of
frozen semen during 1975, liquid semen was
gradually phased out and all the artificial
insemination centres started using frozen semen

from 1993.

Artificial Insemination horizontally
disseminates superior genetic resources in a
population within a short period. With this in mind,
to improve the milk production traits of cattle and
buffaloes, to bring more returns to the farmers and
to increase the State's milk production, artificial

insemination with semen of bulls possessing high
milk production traits is being carried out through
3,479 Artificial Insemination Centres functioning
throughout the State. There are a total of
1,549 Artificial Insemination workers trained by
Tamil Nadu Livestock Development Agency
(TNLDA), through Tamil Nadu Veterinary and
Animal Sciences University (TANUVAS), engaged in
Artificial Insemination programme in the State
besides the above 3,479 Artificial Insemination

Centres.

The revised Breeding Policy of the State for
cattle which is in vogue since 2008–09 provides for
selective breeding of native breeds and for crossing
Non- descript cows with Jersey or Holstein Friesian
depending on agro climatic conditions. Wherever
crossing of Non-descript cows with Exotic
germplasm is practiced the level of exotic

inheritance should be restricted to 50%.

Back-crossing with exotic breeds should be avoided.
Indian breeds like Red Sindhi, Sahiwal and
Tharparkar may also be used for cross breeding the
Non-descript cows. Cross bred cows may be bred
with bulls having 50% Jersey or 50% Holstein
Friesian inheritance by inter-se mating.

Upgrading of Non-descript buffaloes with
Murrah and pure breeding of Toda buffaloes has
been advised in the breeding policy.

livestock diseases is a must, not only for profitable
livestock production but also essential to make our
livestock and livestock products globally acceptable.

Information about the prevalence rate and
disease pattern of the State's livestock population is
critical in the fight against livestock diseases and
this forms the basis for planning and initiating
disease prevention and control strategies. Early
forecasting of diseases and surveillance is essential
to provide early warning signals of outbreaks. Since
adequate awareness levels among farmers
regarding disease prevention and control is not
available, the Department plays a major role in
disease prevention and eradication. The
Department has a systematic Disease control
programme in place that provides for periodical
vaccinations (as per endemic chart) with the
eventual goal of disease containment and

eradication.

For this purpose, 22 Animal Disease
Intelligence Units (ADIUs), 2 Poultry Disease
Diagnostic Laboratories (PDDLs) and one Central
Referral Laboratory (CRL) are functioning in the

State.

**6.5.1 Animal Disease Intelligence Units**


diseases with a view to evolve strategic control
measures at District level. They map disease prone
areas by collecting epidemiological information and
data. This inturn helps in advising the field
veterinarians to take adequate protective and
prophylactic measures well in advance.

The Animal Disease Intelligence Units have an
important role in checking the efficiency of Foot and
Mouth Disease (FMD), Peste-des-Petits Ruminants
(PPR) vaccination by assessing the immunity level
through collecting the serum samples from
vaccinated animals and sending them to Central
Referral Laboratory, Saidapet and collecting serum
and samples of various diseases from simple
parasitic infestations to serious zoonotic diseases
like Brucellosis, Tuberculosis, Para Tuberculosis,
Avian Influenza, IBR, Anthrax and Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) for testing and

surveillance.


purpose,

4,41,268 specimens have been tested by the

**7.1.7.1** **ASSISTANCE** **TO** **STATE** **POULTRY**
**FARMS (80:20)**

The department of Animal Husbandry is
implementing a centrally shared Scheme (80:20)
namely, 'Assistance to State Poultry Farms' in which
the Department-run poultry farms function as a
continuous source of backyard poultry chicks.

This scheme is being implemented to improve
the economic conditions and living standards of
marginal farmers, landless labourers, Self Help
Groups and other socially backward sections of the
society by encouraging them to take up poultry
rearing as an additional avocation, to create
employment opportunities and supplement their
income. Under this Scheme, separate hatchery
units have been established in poultry farms in
District livestock farms of Hosur, Chettinad and
Orathanadu for ‘Giriraja Development’ and one unit
in Kattupakkam Poultry Farm for Vanaraja
Development at a financial outlay of Rs.85 lakh.

Constructions of sheds have been completed
in Kattupakkam poultry farm for Turkey
Development and in District Livestock Farm,
Abishegapatti for Giriraja Development.

To purchase parent stock and feed from
revolving fund and procure equipments, a sum of
Rs.34 lakh has been allocated for Kattupakkam

Scheme and the Scheme is being implemented.

**7.1.8** **Various** **Schemes** **implemented** **in**
**Departmental Farms**

**7.1.8.1 Fodder Development**

Community grazing areas and off-farm fodder
sources have been the important sources of fodder
for livestock. Urbanisation and continuous cropping
combined with the indiscriminate use of grazing
lands has resulted in pastures with very low
biomass production leading to adverse effect on
livestock production. To make dairying economically
attractive, milk production and productivity has to
be enhanced. This is possible only by ensuring that
good quality feed and fodder is made available in
adequate quantities. Therefore, efforts have to be
initiated to improve fodder production and
conservation of agricultural lands for fodder. Since
more areas are brought under food crops cultivation
to meet the food demand for human consumption,
increasing the production capacity of the existing
fodder cultivable lands will be the only beneficial

solution.

A crucial aspect of fodder development is
availability of seed and planting material. Quality
fodder seeds are not readily available. To overcome
### 60


-----

this deficit, the departmental farms are also
functioning as fodder seed banks producing and
supplying seeds and planting material to farmers.
Government has taken initiatives to encourage
farmers for taking up production of high yielding
fodder varieties through various State and Central

schemes.

**7.2 Cattle Breeding and Fodder Development**
**Units**

Cattle Breeding and Fodder Development Units
are functioning one each in 31 Districts (except
Chennai). They are, headed by a Deputy Director of
Animal Husbandry and undertake all the Cattle
Breeding and Fodder Development activities in their
respective districts. Prior to 2013-14, there were
only 20 Cattle breeding and Fodder Development
Units. During 2013-14, 11 Cattle Breeding and
Fodder Development units were newly created.

These Units supply breeding inputs to the
Artificial Insemination centers with regular
periodicity. Liquid Nitrogen, which is essential for
production and storing of Frozen Semen Straws, is
### 65


procured from private sources through tenders
floated by Tamil Nadu Livestock Development
Agency (TNLDA). These units are also responsible
for supply of fodder seeds and monitoring the
fodder development activities to narrow down the
demand supply gap of green fodder.

**7.2.1** **PROVISION** **OF** **BULK** **STORAGE**

**FACILITIES FOR FROZEN SEMEN STRAWS**

Genetic improvement of cattle is a long term
procedure. Bringing all breedable females both
cows and buffaloes into organized breeding
programme through Artificial Insemination is one of
the major components. The effective use of Frozen
Semen Straw and Liquid Nitrogen plays vital role in
this program.

In order to streamline procurement and
distribution of Frozen Semen Straws, Rs.55 lakh has
been alloted for the procurement of 6 Open Mouth
Reservoirs (LNR 320), for the 3 Frozen semen
Production stations viz., Exotic Cattle Breeding
Centre, Eachenkottai and District Livestock Farm,
Hosur and Ooty and 3 Nodal Frozen Semen

**8.2.1.3 Establishment of Broiler Farm**

Broiler Chicken rearing can be undertaken
through integration wherein, integrators supply day
old chicks and feed required for the birds. The
integrators also ensure that the birds are marketed
through their own channels. A broiler farm with
strength of upto 5,000 birds can be profitably run
using family labour alone and thus negates the
requirement of additional man power.

For the year 2012-13, Broiler units were

established in 7 Districts around Sankarankoil and

Villupuram regions of the State. Sankarankoil
Region includes suitable areas in Tirunelveli,
Thoothukudi and Virudhunagar Districts. Likewise,
Villupuram Region includes suitable areas in
Villupuram, Cuddalore, Ariyalur and Perambalur
Districts. During the year 2013-14, in addition to
these Districts, this scheme has been extended to
Vellore and Sivagangai Districts.
### 75


Out of the total target of 1,058 broiler farms
for 2012-13, construction of sheds and Chicks have
been provided to 905 farms by the integrators *.*

Out of the total target of 635 broiler farms for
2013-14, construction of sheds has been completed
and chicks have been provided to 549 farms by the
integrators. Likewise, Out of the total target of 572
broiler farms for 2014-15, construction of sheds has
been completed and chicks have been provided to
151 farms by the integrators. Training for
beneficiaries is being provided by Tamil Nadu
Veterinary and Animal Sciences University
(TANUVAS).

**8.2.1.4 Native Chicken Rearing**

Native chicken rearing is also encouraged

under the Scheme wherein a flock size of about

250 / 500 birds can be profitably reared and
marketed by the farmer himself. The beneficiary is
encouraged to have tie up with Native Chicken
Breeders / Hatchery units for regular supply of
chicks at mutually agreed prices and the beneficiary
himself can do the rearing and marketing since
Native Chicken meat and eggs have a better market
throughout the State.
### 76


-----

During 2012-13, Native Chicken rearing is
encouraged in 16 Districts viz., Dindigul,
Dharmapuri, Kancheepuram, Kanniyakumari, Karur,
Krishnagiri, Madurai, Nagapattinam, Pudukottai,
Ramanathapuram, Sivagangai, Thanjavur,
Thiruvarur, Thiruvallur, Tiruchirappalli and Vellore.
In addition to the above 16 Districts, this scheme

has been extended to Tiruvannamalai District in

2013-14 and to Theni District in2014-15.

For the year 2012-13, construction of sheds
has been completed and chicks have been released

in all the 560 native chicken units.

During 2013-14, out of the target of
3,853 native chicken units allocated, construction of
sheds has been completed and chicks were released
in 3,738 farms. Likewise, for the year 2014-15, out
of total target of 2,800 native chicken units,
construction of sheds has been completed and
chicks have been released in 1,295 farms. Training
for the beneficiaries is being provided by Tamil
Nadu Veterinary and Animal Sciences University
(TANUVAS).

Government of India sanctioned a sum of

Rs.3.49 crore for implementation of this Scheme in
31 Districts (except chennai) @ 440 beneficiaries
per district for the year 2013-14. As per this
Scheme, a total number of 13,658 families living
Below Poverty Line (BPL) (1,712 S.C beneficiaries +
11,946 other beneficiaries) were provided with

45 numbers of 4 week old chicks besides Rs.750

per family for purchasing cages, feeders etc.,
Training was imparted to the beneficiaries by the
concerned Veterinary Assistant Surgeon and
demonstration in nearby Government poultry farm.

**8.3 FODDER DEVELOPMENT**

Feed and Fodder are the major limiting factors
in enhancing livestock productivity. The economic
viability of Animal Husbandry depends on sources of
feed and fodder. Feeding cost constitutes about

65% - 70% of the total cost of the livestock

farming.

The green fodder resources for livestock are
from grass lands, pastures, fodder crops, weeds,
bund grasses, tree leaves and mixed forages. Rapid
urbanization with the increase in requirement of
land for growing food crops have resulted in
shrinking of grazing lands which in turn increased
the gap between demand and availability of green
fodder. Hence it is essential to enhance the green
fodder production by adopting better scientific
management of Agricultural lands and common

property resources.

With the above objective, Government is
implementing State Fodder Development Scheme
since 2011-12. From 2011-12 to 2013-14, a sum of

Rs.65 crore was sanctioned and 52000 acres of

farmers' land were brought under green fodder
cultivation. Through this development, 86.4 LMT of
green fodder has been produced. Besides this to
enhance green fodder production and to avoid
wastage of green fodder fed to animals
4,957 Rainguns and 4,178 power operated Chaff
cutters were distributed to farmers at 75% subsidy.
To facilitate easy and uniform harvest of fodder,
2,500 grass cutters were distributed to the farmers
at 50% subsidy. In order to enlighten the
importance of feeding tree fodder to the animals,
30 lakh Agathi tree seedlings were distributed to

the farmers at free of cost.
### 79


**8.3.1 STATE FODDER DEVELOPMENT SCHEME**

To ensure the continuous availability of fodder,
a sum of Rs.25 crore was allotted during 2014 -15
towards implemetation of State Fodder
Development Scheme. The following activities were

undertaken under this scheme:

**1. Cultivation of High Yielding Fodder Crops**
**under irrigated condition**
Farmers' holdings of 8000 acres were brought
under high biomass yielding perennial fodder grass
Cumbu Napier (Co3/Co4) cultivation under irrigated
condition at an outlay of Rs.6.40 crore. Farmers
were provided with a sum of Rs.2000 as 100%
subsidy per unit of 0.25 acres towards procurement
of slips and fertilizers.

**2.** **Cultivation of sorghum and cowpea under**

**rainfed cultivation**

Farmers' holdings of 40,000 acres were
brought under fodder sorghum and fodder cowpea
cultivation under rain fed condition at an outlay of

Rs.8.80 crore.

**3.** **Distribution of Agathi seeds to farmers**

To sensitize the farmers about the importance
of feeding tree fodder to the animals, farmers are
provided with Agathi seeds at free of cost for taking
up plantation in their own land holdings. 5000 acres
### 80


-----

were brought under Agathi tree plantation at an
outlay of Rs.80 lakh.

**4.Installation of rain guns**

To utilize the available water efficiently and
enhance green fodder production, 2440 acres of
farmers’ land were brought under raingun system of
irrigation across the State at an outlay of Rs.4.575
crore . Each beneficiary has been provided with a
sum of Rs.18,750 as 75% subsidy for installation of
rain gun in an acre.

**5.Propagation of Azolla :**
Azolla is a water plant which is a high quality
fodder rich in protein, can be substituted for green
fodder and produced at a cheaper cost. At a total
outlay of Rs.1.60 crore, 10,000 Azolla units have

been established across the State. Farmers are

provided with 100% assistance of
Rs.1600/unit/farmer.

**8.3.2 ESTABLISHMENT OF FODDER PRODUCTION**

**UNITS IN MEIKKAL POROMBOKE LAND**

A large majority of the farming community in
our State are small and marginal farmers with
limited land holdings. These farmers traditionally
rely on common lands and other common resources
to meet out a significant portion of the fodder
requirements for their livestock. Common lands are
therefore a critical livelihood resource for landless,
### 81


small and marginal farmers. Hence there is a
priority need to rejuvenate the common land
(grazing land) into green fodder production unit.

During 2014 -15, for establishment of Fodder

**8.5.8. VETERINARY PUBLIC HEALTH**

Zoonotic diseases are diseases caused by
infectious agents that can be transmitted between
animals and humans. Controlling zoonoses is
particularly important in developing countries.
Animal husbandry plays important role in
maintaining health of the general public in terms of
prevention of zoonotic diseases. With animal
husbandry forming the core livelihood of millions of
rural population, veterinary public health plays a
vital role in controlling the zoonotic diseases.

**8.5.8.1 Canine Rabies Control Programme:**

Rabies in Human beings and animals is
considered as a major public health problem in
most of the States in India including Tamil Nadu.
Dogs transmit Rabies disease not only to human
beings but also to various other livestock which are
of great economic importance to the stake holders.
Thus, elimination of canine rabies constitutes the
most effective means of controlling transmission to
human beings and other livestock.

With above objective, Canine Rabies Control
Programme Unit is functioning at Madurai and

Tirunelveli. The main functions of these units are:

� Systematic, periodical door-to-door
prophylactic vaccination of pet dogs against
rabies is provided.
### 109


� Post exposure vaccination of all livestock
including dogs is provided free of cost

� Creation of awareness among the public
through publicity and propaganda by
distributing pamphlets and handbills and by
conducting dog shows.

During 2014-15, a total number of 6,498 pet
dogs were vaccinated in the above centres.

**8.5.9 INTENSIVE HEALTH COVER PROGRAMME**

**FOR SHEEP / GOATS**

Sheep / goats are reared mainly by grazing,
thus making them highly vulnerable to
endoparasitism which results in weight loss, delayed
maturity, high mortality rate, low fertility rate etc.,
apart from making them susceptible to other
diseases. This also affects the quality of meat and
carcass yield.

Sheep / goats have to be dewormed
periodically to avoid the above adverse impact. In
this regard, the department is implementing
Intensive Health Cover Programme for sheep /
goats since the year 1982-83. Under this
Programme, the sheep / goats maintained by poor
farmers in all the Districts except Chennai, are
dewormed once in 3 months at their doorsteps.
During the year 2013-14, the Programme was
### 110

**b.** **Embryo transfer programme in Cattle**

Embryo Transfer Technology (ETT) is a tool to
realise the potential of genetically superior cow to
the maximum by producing more number of calves
from each cow within a short period of time to
### 155


achieve the genetic improvement of the herd at a
faster rate than through Artificial Insemination. This
technology is also useful for conservation of
indigenous breeds.

A cow may produce 5-10 calves in a period of
10 to 15 years through the artificial insemination
breeding programme. An elite cow is made to
produce 5 to 15 ova in one oestrous cycle, through
harmonal treatment. By breeding this super
ovulated cow with the semen of a superior bull,
multiple embryos are produced. The embryos are
then collected by non-surgical method, evaluated
and transferred to the recipient cows. The embryos

of the cow can also be frozen and stored for

subsequent use. The frozen embryos can be thawed
and transferred to recipient cows. Thus, up to
50 calves may be produced from one cow through
the Embryo Transfer Technology (ETT) in a short
period of 1-2 years. These recipient cows are
diagnosed for pregnancy after 60 days. Pregnant
recipient cows are given additional concentrate feed
in the last trimester of pregnancy.

The bull calves born through this technology
are purchased at the rate of Rs.5000 per calf and

the heifer calves are left with the farmers.
### 156


-----

Under National Project for Cattle and Buffalo
Breeding (NPCBB), the first phase of the
programme was implemented at a cost of
Rs.50 lakh through the Department of Animal
Husbandry, in coordination with the Tamil Nadu
Veterinary and Animal Sciences University and
Tamil Nadu Milk Producers Co-operative Federation
Ltd., with funding through TNLDA. This programme
was carried out in District Livestock Farm, Hosur
and in the districts of Coimbatore, Madurai, Vellore,
Tiruvanamalai, Dharmapuri, Krishnagiri, Salem and
Namakkal to produce bull calves of high genetic

merit to meet the State’s demand for bull for semen

production.

In order to emulate the success of this

programme, it has been extended to District
Livestock Farm-Abishegapatti, District Livestock
farm-Chettinad, Exotic Cattle Breeding FarmEachenkottai and Erode and Karur districts, at an
estimated cost of Rs.2.50 Crore. So far, 68 calves

**15. CONCLUSION**

Rural economic improvement through
initiatives in Animal Husbandry sector has been
given special impetus by this Government.
Livestock Policy through appropriate programmes
and investments helped in achieving substantially
higher growth rate for milk, meat and egg products.
This has made available the required quantity of
much needed animal protein to the rural poor.
Further, the sector has tremendous potential to
generate employment, provide nutritional security,
enhanced household income through increased
productivity and thus help in poverty reduction
among the rural poor and transformation of rural
scenario. It is acting as an engine in poverty
alleviation by making assetless poor into income
generating asset owning population.

Women targeted welfare programmes like
Free Distribution of Milch Cows and Sheep / Goat
have empowered rural women in the context of
economic freedom. Moreover, additional production
of milk, not only leads to the radiant second White
Revolution as envisaged, but also ensures
substantial household income to the rural poor

women.
### 195


An inclusive approach for development by
making socially and economically weaker sections of
the society as important stakeholders in the
decision making process has ensured equity and
balanced livelihood perspective.

This Department is not only augmenting food
security, empowerment of rural women and rural
youth, but also helps in triggering and invigorating
the rural economy, ultimately contributing
significantly to the comprehensive socio economic

transformation of the rural areas in the State and

thus progressing towards achieving the goals as
envisaged in the Vision 2023 document.
