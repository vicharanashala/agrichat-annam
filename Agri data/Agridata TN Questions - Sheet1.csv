For large stumps, ensure full coverage of bark and cambium ring area - that’s where most nutrient flow occurs.

In non-chemical methods, repeated cutting of new shoots and covering the stump to block sunlight can slowly starve the tree, though it takes longer.",

The next step is Roasting or Steaming, which is to make the shell brittle, loosen the kernel (seed) inside, and release the caustic Cashew Nut Shell Liquid (CNSL). This can be done in two ways. One by Drum Roasting, where the nuts are rotated in a perforated drum over a fire at 180–200°C for 1–2 minutes. Another method is called Steam Roasting, where the nuts are steamed at 120–140°C for 20–30 minutes. After roasting/steaming, nuts are allowed to cool for 12–24 hours to make handling safe.

The next step is called Shelling or Cracking. The cooled nuts are cracked manually using wooden mallets or mechanically using shelling machines. It is done to remove the hard outer shell without damaging the kernel inside. It is estimated that skilled workers can shell up to 20–25 kg in a day manually, while machines can process 50–100 kg in an hour.

After shelling, kernels with testa (the thin brown skin) are dried in a hot-air oven at 70–80°C for 6–8 hours to loosen the testa. The moisture content after this stage should be 3–5%.

This mushroom is full of protein, vitamins, and minerals, and it grows well  weather using simple farm waste like paddy straw. you can get around 2700 tonnes or 27,000 quintal produced every year and also you can use TANU recommended popular variety like Pleurotus sajor-caju (M2) which is high yielding. Spawn packets of about 300 grams are sold from TNAU Mushroom Research and Training Centre, and also by registered private spawn makers, and one packet is enough for one straw bag. Best season is June to February when the temperature is between 20–30°C and humidity is around 60%, but practically farmers are growing it all year round with some humidity control. After sowing spawn, in 25 days pinheads start showing and within 28 days you can take first harvest, and the crop goes on for 45–50 days giving 2–3 flushes. Each bag gives 1.4 to 1.6 kg fresh mushrooms, and if you grow 100 bags you can take 150 kg or 1.5 quintals in one crop or bag, per acre per year if managed well. The big advantage is it needs very low cost, very little land, and gives returns in just 4–6 weeks, plus you can use waste straw which otherwise has no value.

The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) plays a key role in regulating farm-based and agro-processing activities that can impact the environment. 

Rice mills must obtain Consent to Establish (before construction) and Consent to Operate (before starting operations), with dust emission kept below 150 mg/Nm³ and noise levels under 75 dB(A) during the day.

Dairy farms with processing facilities must install Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) capable of treating wastewater to BOD ≤ 30 mg/L and TSS ≤ 50 mg/L before discharge, and ensure proper solid waste disposal. 

Poultry farms housing more than 5,000 birds must have manure drying or composting facilities, odour control measures, and fly management, keeping ammonia levels below 25 ppm in housing areas.

Aquaculture farms, such as shrimp or prawn units above 5 hectares, must maintain a minimum 100 m buffer from water bodies, treat discharge water to BOD ≤ 30 mg/L and total ammonia ≤ 0.5 mg/L, and monitor salinity.

Biogas and composting units must prevent odour nuisance by maintaining hydrogen sulphide (H₂S) levels below 5 ppm and manage leachate to meet discharge standards. 

Agro-chemical formulation units require hazardous waste authorization, ensuring storage in impermeable floors with bunds and disposal via TNPCB-approved TSDFs (Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities).

Missing Specific Examples: A complete answer would provide clear examples of these thresholds. For instance, it should state that a Poultry Farm typically requires a ""Consent to Establish"" from the TNPCB only if the number of birds exceeds 5,000, or a Dairy Farm if it has more than a certain number of animals. Similarly, a Rice Mill requires one if its processing capacity exceeds a specific tonnage per day. Without these numbers, the advice is not actionable.

Vague Contact Point: The advice is incomplete as it doesn't provide a clear, practical first step for a farmer who does need a certificate. An expert answer must direct the farmer to the specific government official. The correct first point of contact is the District Environmental Engineer (DEE) at the local TNPCB office in their district.

Clarify ""Certificate"": An expert would also clarify the terminology. A farmer first applies for a ""Consent to Establish (CTE)"" before setting up the unit, and then a ""Consent to Operate (CTO)"" once it is ready. Using the correct terms is essential for navigating the official process.",,"Pollution Control Certificate may be required when the operation involves potential pollution risks, such as large-scale dairy farms, poultry units, agro-processing industries, or fertilizer/pesticide manufacturing units.

The Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) plays a key role in regulating farm-based and agro-processing activities that can impact the environment. 

Rice mills must obtain Consent to Establish (before construction) and Consent to Operate (before starting operations), with dust emission kept below 150 mg/Nm³ and noise levels under 75 dB(A) during the day.

Dairy farms with processing facilities must install Effluent Treatment Plants (ETPs) capable of treating wastewater to BOD ≤ 30 mg/L and TSS ≤ 50 mg/L before discharge, and ensure proper solid waste disposal. 

Poultry farms housing more than 5,000 birds must have manure drying or composting facilities, odour control measures, and fly management, keeping ammonia levels below 25 ppm in housing areas.

Aquaculture farms, such as shrimp or prawn units above 5 hectares, must maintain a minimum 100 m buffer from water bodies, treat discharge water to BOD ≤ 30 mg/L and total ammonia ≤ 0.5 mg/L, and monitor salinity.

Biogas and composting units must prevent odour nuisance by maintaining hydrogen sulphide (H₂S) levels below 5 ppm and manage leachate to meet discharge standards. 

Agro-chemical formulation units require hazardous waste authorization, ensuring storage in impermeable floors with bunds and disposal via TNPCB-approved TSDFs (Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities).

This is a massive overdose compared to the standard official recommendations from TNAU (Tamil Nadu Agricultural University). Following this advice would be a significant waste of money on fertilizer and could harm the crop.

Missing Correct Information: An expert answer must provide the correct, scientifically recommended dose. The standard TNAU recommendation for Periwinkle is a much lower total dose of 8 kg of Nitrogen, 8 kg of Phosphorus (P₂O₅), and 12 kg of Potassium (K₂O) per acre for the entire season.

Major Technical Error in Terminology: The answer incorrectly translates the nutrient requirement. It states the dose is for ""20 kg Phosphorus"" and ""30 kg Potassium."" However, the fertilizers SSP and MOP supply Phosphorus as P₂O₅ and Potassium as K₂O, which are different units. An expert must use the correct terminology to provide accurate advice.

Incorrect Fertilizer Calculation: Because the base NPK rates are wrong, the final fertilizer quantities are also incorrect. A correct recommendation, based on the standard TNAU dose, would be a basal application of approximately 50 kg of Single Super Phosphate (SSP), 20 kg of Muriate of Potash (MOP), and 9 kg of Urea per acre, followed by a top dressing of another 9 kg of Urea.",,"Periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus) Cultivation needs 8 tonnes of farmyard manure (FYM) per acre during land preparation to enhance soil fertility.

Clipping is generally used to remove damaged or weak plant parts, promote better airflow, and direct the plant’s energy toward more productive growth. For example, in paddy clipping is done to remove the damaged or weak leaves, promoting healthier tillering and stronger plants. In cotton clipping is used to remove the terminal bud or weak growing tips to encourage side branching and a fuller plant. In tomato, sometimes clipping is done to remove damaged or lower leaves, improving air circulation and reducing disease risks. For brinjal clipping is done to remove damaged or lower leaves to improve plant health and boost fruiting.

Incorrect Disease Diagnosis: It wrongly attributes the mosaic symptoms to ""Tomato Leaf Curl Virus."" While the insect vectors can be the same, an expert should be more precise. The more likely viral culprits for mosaic symptoms in a cucurbit like Chow Chow are Cucumber Mosaic Virus (CMV) or Watermelon Mosaic Virus (WMV).

Missing Safe Alternatives and PHI: A responsible expert answer must replace the banned chemical with a safe, legal, and effective systemic insecticide to control the aphid/whitefly vectors.

The chemical is sold at Agricultural Technology Information Centre of the Directorate of Extension Education, Coimbatore. Since the tree killer has an ingredient which is highly toxic, it needs to be handled with great care. It should not come into direct contact with human body. It should be kept out reach of children. The container after use has to be buried and disposed off safely. The tree killer totally eradicates trees and shrubs that cause nuisance at temple premises, roof tops, walls of buildings, wells, canal bunds and shutters. The bark around the base of tree / shrub to be killed has to be removed to a height of 10 cm from the ground. The tree killer has to be swabbed using a brush over the area of the stem without bark immediately before it dries. Further a waste cloth has to be tied / wound around the area which is to be soaked / drenched with the chemical again. It is enough if tree killer is applied once. Trees will start drying after some time and they will not revive.","https://agritech.tnau.ac.in/crop_protection/crop_prot_pesticides_tree%20killer.html#:~:text=TNAU%20Agritech%20Portal%20::%20Crop,wells%2C%20canal%20bunds%20and%20shutters.","Tree Killer is a chemical developed by Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) to control unwanted trees and shrubs in places like temple premises, rooftops, and canal bunds.

You can either let a broody duck sit and hatch naturally, or you can use an artificial incubator if you want more control and higher hatch rate. In incubators, keep the temperature around 37.2–37.5°C (99–99.5°F) and maintain proper humidity. For the first 25 days, keep wet-bulb temperature near 30–31°C (86–88°F), then slightly increase to 33°C (90°F) in the last 3 days. Always turn eggs every hour and from day 2 to 25 sprinkle a little lukewarm water mixed with sanitizer to keep shells moist and clean. On day 7, do candling to check if embryos are growing, and by day 25 shift eggs to the hatcher. After hatching, ducklings need brooding for 3–4 weeks, starting with around 32°C (90°F) temperature and then slowly reducing.

Next Infectious Bronchitis which looks like cold and cough in chickens but very harmful as birds stop growing, lay poor quality or misshapen eggs and may your egg sales fall. Then Marek’s disease attacks mainly young chicks causing paralysis in legs and wings and even tumors inside body, birds waste away and immunity also drops, farmer has to replace flock and spend more money. Also next one is Infectious Bursal Disease which farmers call Gumboro, it kills young chicks by white diarrhea, swollen bursa and weakens their immunity, mortality can touch 80–90% and even surviving birds never grow well, farmers may face major profit loss and disease recurrence costs. Last one is Avian Influenza or Bird Flu is very severe, suddenly birds die with bleeding, swelling in face and comb, whole farm can be sealed and culled by government, no sale allowed and farmer goes into heavy loss both money wise and heart wise.

A basic manual walk-behind model typically ranges from one point five to two point five lakh rupees. A more advanced four-row riding type transplanter can cost between three point 500000 to 650000 rupees. After applying the maximum subsidy, the effective out-of-pocket cost for a four-row machine would be approximately two point seven five lakh rupees for a model priced at four lakh rupees. The area a transplanter can cover depends on its type. A manual walk-behind transplanter operated by a single person can cover approximately zero point three to zero point four acres in a full day. A four-row riding type machine is significantly more efficient, capable of transplanting two to three acres per day during an eight to ten hour operating period.

The subsidy scheme is available to individual farmers, Custom Hiring Centers, and Farmer Producer Organizations. The price of a paddy transplanter varies considerably based on its type and features. A basic manual walk-behind model typically ranges from one point five to two point five lakh rupees. A more advanced four-row riding-type transplanter can cost between 350000 and 650000 rupees. After applying the maximum subsidy, the effective out-of-pocket cost for a four-row machine would be approximately two point seven five lakh rupees for a model priced at four lakh rupees. The area a transplanter can cover depends on its type. A manual walk-behind transplanter operated by a single person can cover approximately zero point three to zero point four acres in a full day. A four-row riding-type machine is significantly more efficient, capable of transplanting two to three acres per day during an eight- to ten-hour operating period. The application process for the subsidy is conducted online through the official MP State Agro Portal. Farmers must first register on the portal using their personal and land details. After registration, they can log in, locate the agricultural mechanization subsidy section, and select the paddy transplanter from the list of available implements. The application requires uploading necessary documents for verification by district agricultural officers. Once approved, the subsidy amount is transferred directly to the farmer's registered bank account.

Chemical control involves Pendimethalin (405 g/acre)—applied immediately after sowing for both broad- and narrow-leaved weeds—or Sulfosulfuron (13.6 g/acre)—applied within 35 days after sowing—or Metribuzin (101 g/acre)—applied within 35 days after sowing—or 2,4-D (162–202 g/acre)—for broad-leaved weeds, applied within 35 days—or Isoproturon (303 g/acre)—for grassy weeds, applied within 20 days of sowing—or Isoproturon + 2,4-D (303 g + 303 g/acre)—for targeting both broad- and narrow-leaved weeds.

This stage, also known as the milk-dough stage or grain-filling stage, occurs when the kernels in the wheat head begin to fill with a milky-white liquid. The milking stage is one of the most critical growth stages for wheat. During this period, the plant is at its peak requirement for water. A lack of moisture during this time can severely impact the final yield. Water is essential for the proper development and filling of the grains. Inadequate water can lead to shrunken, shriveled, and lighter grains, significantly reducing the final yield and market value. Proper soil moisture ensures that the plant can efficiently absorb and transport nutrients from the soil to the developing grains. The milking stage typically occurs 100-105 days after sowing (DAS). It is often the fifth irrigation in a standard irrigation schedule for wheat in the region. The exact timing can vary slightly depending on the wheat variety, soil type, and prevailing weather conditions. The amount of water required for irrigation at the milking stage, and for the entire crop duration can vary. A typical irrigation depth is 6-8 cm.

This stage, also known as the milk-dough stage or grain-filling stage, occurs when the kernels in the wheat head begin to fill with a milky-white liquid. The milking stage is one of the most critical growth stages for wheat. During this period, the plant is at its peak requirement for water. A lack of moisture during this time can severely impact the final yield. Water is essential for the proper development and filling of the grains. Inadequate water can lead to shrunken, shriveled, and lighter grains, significantly reducing the final yield and market value. Proper soil moisture ensures that the plant can efficiently absorb and transport nutrients from the soil to the developing grains. The milking stage typically occurs 100-105 days after sowing (DAS).

Wheat becomes very dry and easy to catch fire when fully ripe. Main causes of fire are cigarette sparks, electric sparks from damaged transformers or wires, hot parts or silencer sparks from tractors, combines, or threshers, burning wheat straw or crop residue, and careless handling of fire near fields. To prevent fire, never allow smoking near the wheat field, especially during harvesting and drying time. Always keep electric poles and transformers in good condition and avoid working near them in very dry weather. Make sure machines are well maintained—keep the silencer mouth facing upward, check for oil leaks, and do not overheat engines while working. Do not burn wheat straw; instead, use it as fodder or for mulching the field to improve soil health. Make small firebreaks (empty strip of land) around the field and always keep watch during harvest time when the weather is dry and windy. Keep a few buckets of water, soil, or a small fire extinguisher nearby to quickly stop any small fire before it spreads. If fire happens, first turn off all engines and machines close to the fire so it does not get bigger, move tractors or tools away from fire, and call local fire services if the fire cannot be controlled. By following these simple steps carefully, you can protect your wheat crop, save your life, and secure your income from unexpected fire loss.

In the answer you have mentioned stem rot but the question is about leaf rot (sheath rot), kindly thoroughly read the answer and do the necessary changes by placing the correct disease name.",,"Paddy shows several disease, like leaf rot is commonly known as Sheath Rot, a serious problem in paddy crops. Sheath rot is caused by the fungus Sarocladium oryzae and generally affects rice from late tillering to maturity, especially in fields with standing water and excessive nitrogen use. Symptoms include grey to brown lesions on the upper leaf sheath (that encloses the flowering panicle), white powdery fungal growth inside the sheath, incomplete panicle emergence, and shrivelled or sterile grains. Affected sheaths may rot, and panicles often fail to fully emerge, resulting in poor grain filling and yield losses. To stop it, first you can follow crop rotation with wheat or maize, don’t overuse urea, and keep proper water management — if you see infection, drain water for 4–5 days. Use recommended tolerant varieties like NDR 359, Jaya, MTU 7029, Swarna Sub-1, and  Sahbhagi Dhan for better safety. For chemical control, you can foliar spray Validamycin 3% L @ 400 ml per acre or Propiconazole 25% EC @ 200 ml in 200 litres of water per acre with a knapsack or power sprayer. As an alternative, you can use Hexaconazole 5% EC @ 400 ml/acre — it also works well and is safe for paddy. Start the spray whenever you can see the first symptom. Make sure you cover the base of the tillers where the rot starts, keep a 10–12 day gap between sprays if repeat is needed, and you should maintain a pre-harvest interval (PHI) of at least 14 days for Validamycin 3% L, 15 days for Propiconazole 25% EC, and 14–15 days for Hexaconazole 5% EC to ensure no chemical residue remains in the grains or straw before harvest. For eco-friendly and residue-free management, apply Trichoderma harzianum formulation @ 1 kg/acre mixed with 50 kg well-decomposed FYM or vermicompost and broadcast in the field at puddling or transplanting. This beneficial fungus competes with the stem rot pathogen and reduces its survival in soil, giving long-term protection. Repeat once mid-season if field history shows high disease pressure.

Zinc and iron deficiencies are common in wheat. Zinc deficiency leads to stunted growth and a reddish-brown discoloration of the leaves. Iron deficiency causes interveinal chlorosis (yellowing of the leaves while the veins remain green). To manage these deficiencies, foliar sprays of 0.5% zinc sulphate solution (5 grams zinc sulphate + 2.5 grams lime in 1 litre of water) and 0.5% ferrous sulphate solution (5 grams ferrous sulphate + 2.5 grams lime in 1 litre of water) are very effective. Plant growth regulators (PGRs) such as gibberellic acid promote tillering (the formation of new shoots from the base of the plant), which increases the number of grain-bearing heads. Chlormequat chloride can be used to shorten the plant's height and strengthen the stem, making it less susceptible to lodging (bending or falling over due to wind or rain).",https://iiwbr.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EB-52-Wheat-Cultivation-in-India-Pocket-Guide.pdf https://epubs.icar.org.in/index.php/JWR/article/view/152738 https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11005776/

Seed treatment with Mancozeb (2 gm/kg of seed) before sowing eliminates. seed-borne diseases like loose smut, and try to avoid delayed sowing. Maintaining 22.5 cm row spacing improves air circulation and reduces disease spread.For rust control, propiconazole 25% EC works effectively at 1.0 ml per liter of water, (200-250 ml/acre) when first symptoms appear, repeating after 15 days if needed or Tebuconazole 25% EC provides another option at 0.5 ml per liter (100-120 ml per acre) with 10-15 days of interval period. For Karnal bunt and powdery mildew, use sulfur 80% WP at 2.0 gm/liter (1kg/acre) sprayed in the early morning. Loose smut prevention needs seed treatment with carboxin 37.5% + thiram 37.5% DS at 2.5 gm/kg seed.Rotating different fungicide groups prevents disease resistance development.Organic alternatives include neem oil at 3 ml/liter (500 ml/acre).

Termites can damage the sown seeds, leading to poor germination and a reduced plant stand. Termites feed on the roots and lower parts of the stems of young plants. Affected plants show signs of wilting and yellowing. In mature plants, the most characteristic symptom is the appearance of dry, white earheads that contain no grains. This is caused by termites feeding on the base of the stalk, cutting off the nutrient supply to the ear. The white ears can be easily pulled out of the ground. A combination of preventive and chemical measures is the most effective way to manage termites in wheat such as ploughing the field deeply during the summer months exposes termite colonies and queens to the sun and predatory birds, killing them and reducing the initial population. Ensure that you use well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM). The use of fresh or improperly decomposed manure can attract termites. Termites prefer dry soil. Keeping the field adequately moist during the early stages can help in reducing termite activity. Give a seed treatment of Imidacloprid 70% WS @ 3-5 grams per kg of seeds for seed treatment or Thiamethoxam 70% WS @ 2-3 grams per kg seed treatment. Mix the required amount of powder with a small amount of water to make a slurry. Coat the wheat seeds evenly with this slurry before sowing. This provides protection for the initial 30-45 days.

The disease appears at the flowering stage, replacing grains with black powdery spores. Since the fungus grows internally within the seed, prevention through seed treatment is crucial. Several wheat varieties show resistance to loose smut in Punjab conditions, like HD 2967, which demonstrates moderate resistance against the disease. PBW 725 offers good resistance to both loose smut and rust diseases. WH 1105 shows tolerance to smut and other foliar diseases. PBW 550, recommended for Punjab, provides moderate resistance.

Use plastic trays (2–3 inch deep) or earthen pots with small holes at the bottom for drainage. Fill with a mixture of 50% garden soil + 50% well-rotted compost/vermicompost. Level the surface. Spread sprouted seeds evenly on the tray/bed surface. Cover lightly with a thin layer of soil or compost. Keep in shade for 1–2 days until seedlings emerge. Sprinkle water daily (do not overwater). Keep trays in semi-shade or indirect sunlight. Avoid strong direct afternoon sun (especially in the summer). No chemical fertilizer/pesticide needed (kept organic). Wheatgrass will be ready in 7–10 days when the height reaches 6–8 inches. Cut just above the root level with clean scissors. One tray can give 2–3 harvests if maintained properly. Making wheatgrass juice - Wash harvested wheatgrass thoroughly. Use a slow juicer/wheatgrass juicer (not a normal mixer, as it may heat the juice). Grind/crush the wheatgrass with a little water and strain through a fine muslin cloth or strainer. Consume immediately (oxidizes fast), benefits 30–50 ml fresh juice daily on an empty stomach, rich in chlorophyll, iron, vitamins A, C, E, B-complex, calcium, magnesium.

This also makes your crop more susceptible to diseases and pests because when we apply excess nitrogen fertilizer to crops, the plants grow very fast and produce soft, lush, and tender leaves. These tender leaves contain more sap, amino acids, and sugars, which act like “ready food” for many sucking pests such as aphids, whiteflies, jassids, and leafhoppers, as well as for caterpillars. Because the plant tissues remain soft, pests can easily suck or chew them, and the crop becomes more attractive to attacks. Furthermore, excessive nitrogen can harm the quality of your soil by increasing its acidity and reducing its overall health over time, potentially leading to deficiencies in other vital nutrients for your crops. It can even lead to nitrate leaching, contaminating groundwater which can affect human and animal health. To prevent these issues, it is always best to base your nitrogen application on soil tests and follow the recommended doses for your specific region and wheat variety, including using balanced and integrated nutrient management with both organic and inorganic sources of nutrients.

These inspections focus on identifying key threats such as rust diseases—especially Yellow Rust and Brown Rust—which can cause severe yield losses if not managed early. Other important diseases include Karnal Bunt, Loose Smut, and Powdery Mildew. Common insect pests include aphids, which suck sap and can transmit diseases; Yellow Stem Borers, which damage seedlings and young tillers; and termites, which attack the root zone and weaken plants. Armyworms and cutworms are also serious pests that can destroy large portions of the crop if left unchecked. Inspections are conducted at all major crop stages, from early growth through to pre-harvest, and also involve checking for off-types—undesirable or genetically different plants that reduce seed purity and grain quality.

After December 5 sowing, irrigation should be continued up to April 10. During cloudy days, irrigation must be avoided to prevent lodging of the crop.

https://www.pau.edu/content/ccil/pf/pp_rabi.pdf","The time to avoid irrigation depends mainly on the crop, soil type, growth stage, and weather, but in general, it is advisable not to irrigate just before or after certain critical events like immediately after fertilizer or pesticide application (unless it’s meant to be incorporated). it is required to wait at least 24 hours to prevent nutrient loss or chemical wash-off.  For Urea, irrigation must be applied immediately after broadcasting to dissolve the granules and prevent significant nitrogen loss to the atmosphere.

 Irrigation decisions must always be crop-specific. In paddy, irrigation should be avoided at the time of grain ripening, since excess water at maturity delays harvest and lowers grain quality. 
In onion, over-irrigation during the maturity and bulb-drying stage should be avoided, as it reduces storability and causes rotting.
 For mustard, irrigation must not be given at the flowering and pod-maturity stage, because excess moisture encourages diseases and shattering. In most vegetables, especially cucurbits and solanaceous crops, irrigation should be avoided during flowering and immediately before harvest, as water stress or excess moisture at these stages can either reduce fruit set or affect keeping quality. 

Before harvest of crops like paddy, groundnut, onion, or sugarcane  the usual practice is to stop irrigation for 7–15 days before harvest to allow proper drying and improve quality.


After heavy rain it is better to wait until the topsoil is dry enough to prevent root diseases and compaction; this can take 3–5 days depending on soil type.

The official Package of Practices (POP) advises irrigating based on the critical growth stages of the crop. ",,"The critical stages of irrigation in wheat are those where water stress can cause maximum yield loss. 

The most important is the Crown Root Initiation (CRI) stage at 20–25 days after sowing, which is essential for root development and tillering. The second critical stage is tillering (40–45 DAS), when side shoots develop and determine the number of productive tillers. 

The jointing stage (stem elongation) also requires adequate moisture for healthy crop growth.

 Irrigation at the flowering stage ensures proper pollination and grain set, while at the grain-filling or milk/dough stage, it supports kernel development and prevents shriveled grains. 

However, irrigation should be avoided immediately after sowing to prevent seed rotting, and also just before crop maturity, as excess moisture at this stage can reduce grain quality and delay harvesting. During cloudy days, irrigation must be avoided to prevent lodging of the crop.
