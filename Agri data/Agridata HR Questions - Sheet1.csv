Use resistant varieties like Arka Rakshak or Swarna Lalima, which are suitable for Haryana. (US 440 is a private hybrid; confirm local recommendation before use.) Remove and burn infected leaves to stop the spread. Follow label instructions and wear hand gloves and a mask while spraying for safety. The most important rule for safety is the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI): you must wait 7-10 days after spraying Mancozeb and 5-7 days after the systemic spray before harvesting any tomatoes.",

Better to suggest Soil test first.
Overuse or underuse of DAP can impact yield and soil health; soil tests ensure correct application.

- Suggest splitting urea application as one part at basal (before or at transplanting) and two splits at 10â€“12 DAT (days after transplanting) and 30â€“40 DAT.
This improves nitrogen uptake and reduces losses, matching recommended best practices.

- Confirm that zinc sulphate at 25kg per acre is a standard recommendation, but use only for zinc-deficient soils or at critical deficiency stages.
Applying zinc without confirmed deficiency may not be necessary; confirm through soil testing if possible.

- Use FYM (farmyard manure) at 2 tons per acre at final land preparation to improve soil organic matter and supply secondary nutrients.
This is consistent with regional advice and supports better nutrient balance and soil health.

The Science of Modern Varieties: The reason for the error is that modern paddy varieties—both Basmati and non-Basmati—have a very high tillering capacity (one healthy seedling produces many stems). Using the old high seed rates causes severe overcrowding, which suppresses tillering and increases the risk of disease.

Correct, Sourced Recommendations for Haryana: The official advice from research institutes is much lower and depends on the specific paddy type:

For Non-Basmati (Parmal) varieties like the PR series: The correct transplanting seed rate is 8-10 kg per acre.

For Basmati varieties like Pusa Basmati 1121: The rate is 8 kg per acre.

For high-tillering Basmati like Pusa Basmati 1509: The rate is only 5-6 kg per acre.

To control tela, always sow recommended high yielding varieties like HD-3086, or WH-1105 which show better tolerance. Avoid too early sowing. If symptom is seen, spray Imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 100 ml per acre or Thiamethoxam 25 WG @ 40 gram per acre in 200 litres water. Both are safe and effective. Use fan type nozzle for proper coverage.

Use a fresh culture packet (e.g., 200 g per 10 kg seed), prepare a slurry, and coat the seeds uniformly. After treatment, dry the seeds in shade before sowing to maintain seed viability and ensure effective treatment.

Dange,"Wheat crops often suffer from nutrient deficiencies that can significantly reduce yield and quality. There are several types of deficiency, like nitrogen deficiency, which is characterized by yellowing of older leaves and stunted growth. To control this, apply urea at 50–100 kg/acre in split doses, with half at sowing and half at tillering. A foliar spray of 2% urea solution (20 gm/liter of water) can also help.
Phosphorus deficiency leads to purple or reddish leaves and poor root development. Use DAP at 50–75 kg/acre as a basal application or SSP at 100–115 kg/acre. A foliar spray of 1–2% DAP solution (10–20 gm/liter of water) can be used if needed.
Potassium deficiency causes yellowing and browning of leaf edges and weak stems. Apply MOP at 25–50 kg/acre or SOP at 30–60 kg/acre. A foliar spray of 1% potassium sulfate (10 gm/liter of water) can correct deficiencies quickly.
Zinc deficiency results in interveinal chlorosis and white streaks on young leaves. Apply zinc sulfate at 10–20 kg/acre every 2–3 years, or use a foliar spray of 0.5% zinc sulfate (5 gm/liter of water) with lime to prevent leaf burn.
Iron deficiency shows as yellowing between veins in young leaves. A foliar spray of 0.5–1% ferrous sulfate (5–10 gm/liter of water) with citric acid improves absorption.
Sulfur deficiency causes uniform yellowing of young leaves and reduces grain protein. Apply gypsum at 50–100 kg/acre or ammonium sulfate at 25–50 kg/acre.
Boron deficiency leads to poor grain setting and hollow stems. Use borax at 2–5 kg/acre or a foliar spray of 0.2% borax (2 gm/liter of water) at flowering.
Magnesium deficiency causes yellowing between veins in older leaves. A foliar spray of 1% magnesium sulfate (10 gm/liter of water). 
For best results, conduct soil testing before applying fertilizers. A balanced NPK ratio of 120:60:40 kg per acre is recommended, adjusted based on soil test results. Organic options like FYM, compost, and vermicompost (5–10 tons/acre) also improve soil health.","https://www.ccsihau.ac.in/pdf/package-of-practices/Package-of-Practices-for-Cereals.pdf

A foliar spray of 1–2% DAP solution (10–20 g/L of water) can be used if needed. Potassium deficiency: Causes yellowing and browning of leaf edges and weak stems. Apply MOP at 25–50 kg/acre or SOP at 30–60 kg/acre. A foliar spray of 1% potassium sulfate (10 g/L of water) can correct deficiencies quickly. Zinc deficiency: Results in interveinal chlorosis and white streaks on young leaves. Apply zinc sulfate at 10–20 kg/acre every 2–3 years, or use a foliar spray of 0.5% zinc sulfate (5 g/L of water) with lime to prevent leaf burn. Iron deficiency: Shows as yellowing between veins in young leaves. A foliar spray of 0.5–1% ferrous sulfate (5–10 g/L of water) with citric acid improves absorption. Sulfur deficiency: Causes uniform yellowing of young leaves and reduces grain protein. Apply gypsum at 50–100 kg/acre or ammonium sulfate at 25–50 kg/acre. Boron deficiency: Leads to poor grain setting and hollow stems. Use borax at 2–5 kg/acre or a foliar spray of 0.2% borax (2 g/L of water) at flowering. Magnesium deficiency: Causes yellowing between veins in older leaves. Apply a foliar spray of 1% magnesium sulfate (10 g/L of water). For best results, conduct soil testing before applying fertilizers. A balanced NPK ratio of 120:60:40 kg per acre is recommended, adjusted based on soil test results. Organic options like FYM, compost, and vermicompost (5–10 tons/acre) also improve soil health.",https://iiwbr.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Advisory-to-wheat-farmers-January-1-15-2025.pdf https://pau.edu/content/ccil/pf/pp_rabi.pdf https://niphm.gov.in/IPMPackages/Wheat.pdf

Dange,"The pora method is a traditional wheat sowing technique still practice in parts of this region, particularly for late-sown crops. This method involves broadcasting wheat seeds manually across a prepared field at a rate of 40-50 kg/acre. After seed scattering, farmers perform light plowing or harrowing to mix the seeds into the top 2-3 cm of soil. The key step involves dragging a wooden plank called a pora over the field to compact the soil and improve seed-to-soil contact. Immediate light irrigation follows to ensure proper germination.
This method offers several advantages for certain farming situations. It requires minimal equipment, making it accessible to small farmers without seed drills. The process is faster than mechanical drilling, which helps when sowing is delayed after paddy harvest. Pora works particularly well in light-textured sandy-loam soils where conventional drills may struggle. The soil compaction from planking helps retain moisture, which is beneficial in water-scarce conditions.
The pora method has significant limitations compared to modern techniques. It uses substantially more seed (40-50 kg/acre) compared to drill sowing (25-30 kg/acre). The uneven seed distribution often leads to patchy crop stands and variable plant density. Fertilizer application is less precise, reducing nutrient use efficiency. Weed pressure tends to be higher due to shallow seed placement and uneven field conditions.
The pora method works best in particular field conditions. Light-textured soils with good drainage are most suitable for this approach. The technique shows advantage when time is limited after paddy harvest and drill equipment isn't available. Small-scale farmers with limited resources may find it more practical than investing in seed drills.

Light trap is simple and effective Integrated Pest Management (IPM) tool used to attract trap and kill night flying insets. In light traps there re three main parts 1. A light source: which include usually 100-200 watts bulb/CFL/LED lights that emits ultraviolet or visible light. 2. A funnel: Placed below the light to guide attracted insect downwards. 3. A collection chamber: A container at the bottom of the funnel which is filled with water or small amount of kerosene ,insecticides to kill the insects. The Trap is set up in the field on a pole with the light source about 1-2 feet above the crop canopy. It should be operated during evening from dusk to about 10 pm. ( 7PM to 10 PM). A light traps serves two main purpose for your wheat crop 1. Monitoring which is most important function.

In agriculture, it is used in very small quantities as a micronutrient supplement and as a plant growth regulator to improve stress tolerance. In cotton cultivation, cobalt chloride is not used as a primary fertilizer or a routine pesticide.

It acts as an ethylene production inhibitor, counteracting the effects of ethylene, which is believed to be a contributing factor to parawilt. A plant growth regulator to help the plant cope with stress, particularly water stress (drought). Its main functions are Improving Drought Tolerance: Cobalt helps plants regulate water loss by influencing the opening and closing of stomata (pores on the leaves). Reducing Flower and Boll Drop: By mitigating water stress, it helps the plant retain its squares (flower buds) and bolls during dry spells, which is critical for protecting the final yield. Enhancing Plant Health: Cobalt is a component of Vitamin B12, which is involved in nitrogen fixation and other essential plant processes, leading to better overall plant health. Cobalt chloride is applied as a foliar spray. The spray is most effective when applied at the start of the critical flowering and boll formation stage. This is typically when the crop is around 60-70 days old. Applying it at this time helps the plant manage any water stress that might occur during this peak reproductive phase. Using the correct dosage is extremely important, as excessive cobalt can be toxic to plants. The recommendations are for very low concentrations. The standard recommendation is a 10 ppm (parts per million) solution. To make this, you need to mix 10 milligrams of cobalt chloride in 1 litre of water.

A common issue faced is the yellowing of wheat crops, a symptom of stress rather than a single disease. Accurately identifying the cause is essential for effective treatment. Carefully observe the pattern of yellowing in the field. If the leaves show distinct yellow stripes parallel to the veins and release a yellow-orange powder when touched, the crop is likely suffering from Yellow Rust (Pili Kungi). This is a fungal disease that requires immediate attention. If the yellowing is uniform across the leaves without any stripes, it is likely a nutrient deficiency. If the yellowing starts on the lower, older leaves and moves upwards, it indicates a Nitrogen Deficiency. Conversely, if it appears on the upper, newer leaves, it points to a Sulphur Deficiency. Yellowing can also appear in scattered patches throughout the field. This could be due to Zinc Deficiency, characterized by yellowing between the veins of the middle leaves, or it could be a sign of waterlogging in low-lying areas after heavy rain. Once the cause is identified, the correct treatment can be applied. For Yellow Rust, an immediate fungicide spray is critical. A recommended dosage is 200 ml of Propiconazole 25% EC or Tebuconazole 250 EC mixed in 200 liters of water per acre. The best long-term prevention is to sow rust-resistant varieties of wheat. Nitrogen Deficiency is corrected by applying Urea as a top dressing. As per PAU recommendations, farmers should apply 55 kg of Urea per acre with the first irrigation and another 55 kg with the second irrigation. For Sulphur Deficiency, using Single Super Phosphate (SSP) at the time of sowing is the best preventive method.

These varieties are known for their excellent grain quality, aroma, and yield potential and are preferred by farmers for Basmati rice cultivation.",https://www.pau.edu/content/ccil/pf/pp_kharif.pdf,"The problem of mango trees producing a heavy crop one year and a light or no crop the next is a well-known issue called Alternate Bearing, also referred to as a ""yearly break"" in production. This happens because a tree uses up its energy and nutrients to produce a huge crop in the ""on-year,"" leaving it exhausted for the next season. The fruits themselves produce hormones that also prevent new flower buds from forming. Certain varieties, like Dashehari and Langra, are naturally more prone to this than others. To get a consistent harvest every year, you need to use a combination of techniques. First, proper pruning is a critical step, especially for older, thick trees. The best time to prune is right after harvest, in June or July. By lightly pruning, you open up the tree's canopy, allowing sunlight and air to reach the inner branches. This encourages new shoots to grow, which will produce fruit the next year. Second, ensure your trees have balanced nutrition. A well-fed tree is better equipped to handle the stress of heavy fruiting. Apply fertilizers in two phases: the first in June-July after pruning and the second in September-October. A good mix includes Farm Yard Manure (FYM), Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potash. While a soil test is ideal for precise amounts, a mature tree generally needs 50-100 kg of FYM along with a mix of chemical fertilizers. Another effective technique is de-blossoming. In an ""on-year"" when the tree is flowering heavily, you can manually remove about 50-60% of the flower clusters. This prevents the tree from over-exhausting itself, allowing it to produce a moderate crop while saving enough energy to flower again the following year. Finally, for a highly effective chemical solution, you can use growth regulators like Paclobutrazol. This chemical works by temporarily stopping leafy growth and redirecting the tree's energy into producing new flower buds. It should be applied to the soil around the tree's trunk about three months before the normal flowering time, usually in September or October in most parts of India. The correct dosage is crucial and depends on the size of the tree's canopy. To use 3-4 ml of the chemical per meter of canopy diameter. The solution is poured into a small trench or a few holes dug around the tree's base. By consistently applying these methods, pruning, balanced fertilization, and, if necessary, de-blossoming or using growth regulators, you can help break the cycle of alternate bearing and ensure a more stable mango harvest year after year.",TRUE,-,,"Paddy is a kharif-season crop.

Instead, intercrop or use border crops like moong, urad, soybean, castor, or sorghum which disturb pest and disease build-up. After harvest, remove and burn crop residues to stop carryover. Manage irrigation properly so the crop doesn’t grow too lush, and apply fertilizers in balance, avoiding excess nitrogen which makes the crop more prone to disease. For biological control in cotton, apply about 1.2 trillion NPV POBs per acre during evening at 7th and 12th week; release 2.5 cc Trichogramma egg parasitoids per acre every 15 days three times from 45 days after sowing; and release approximately 40,500 Chelonus blackburnii and Chrysoperla carnea per acre at 6th, 13th, and 14th weeks for natural larvae control. For extra effect, ULV spray of NPV with cotton seed kernel extract, crude sugar, Tinopal and Teepol works well, and remember Dicofol, methyl demeton and phosalone are safer for friendly insects like Chrysoperla. For seed treatment, use Carboxin 37.5% + Thiram 37.5% DS @ 3.5 g/kg seed for root rot and blight, or Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10 g/kg seed for blight, and for seedling diseases treat with Fluxapyroxad @ 1.5 ml/kg seed or Tetraconazole @ 1.5 ml/kg seed. If infestation is seen in the field, drench symptomatic and nearby plants with Trichoderma harzianum or T. viride 1% WP @ 50 g in 10 litres water per acre, or with Carbendazim 50 WP @ 20 g in 10 litres water per acre. In case of sooty mould, spray Flonicamid 160 g, or Propiconazole 400 ml, or Copper Oxychloride 1 kg, each per acre in 400 litres of water. By following this combined method you can control blight disease in Cotton.

Dange,"Paddy fields are susceptible to several fungal diseases that can severely impact crop yield and quality. The most common fungal infections affecting rice include blast, sheath blight, brown spot, false smut, bakanae disease, and stem rot, each requiring specific management approaches.
Blast disease looks like spindle-shaped lesions on leaves with gray centers and brown margins. For controlling it, you can use Tricyclazole 75% WP at 0.5 gm/liter of water (100-120 gm/acre) or Isoprothiolane 40% EC at 1.5 ml/liter (300-350 ml/acre). Recommended resistant varieties include Pusa Basmati 1121, CR Dhan 701, and IR 64, which show good tolerance against blast infection.
Sheath blight manifests as oval lesions on leaf sheaths near the water level. You can apply Validamycin 3% L at 2.5 ml/liter (500 ml/acre) or Hexaconazole 5% SC at 2 ml/liter (400 ml/acre) for effective control. Varieties like Swarna Sub-1, MTU 1010, and BPT 5204 demonstrate resistance to sheath blight.
Brown spot disease appears as small dark brown spots on leaves and can be managed using Mancozeb 75% WP at 2 gm/liter (400-500 gm/acre) or Carbendazim 50% WP at 1 gm/liter (200 gm/acre). IR 36 and CR 1009 are among the varieties showing tolerance to brown spot infection.
False smut has greenish-black spore balls on panicles. Control measures include spraying Propiconazole 25% EC at 1 ml/liter (200 ml/acre) or using Copper Oxychloride 50% WP at 2 gm/liter (500 gm/acre) as a preventive spray. PR 113 and Pusa 44 varieties exhibit resistance to false smut.
Bakanae disease, it looks abnormally tall, pale seedlings. Seed treatment with Carbendazim 50% WP at 2 gm/kg seed is effective, followed by foliar spray of Thio-phanate-methyl 70% WP at 1 gm/liter (200 gm/acre). Pusa Basmati 1509 and PB 1121 are resistant varieties against bakanae disease.
Stem rot shows black lesions on stems and can be controlled with a combination of Carbendazim 50% WP (1 gm/liter) and Mancozeb 75% WP (2 gm/liter), requiring 200 gm and 400 gm/acre, respectively. IR 50 and ADT 43 varieties show tolerance to stem rot infection.
For all fungicide applications, use 200-250 liters of water per acre for proper coverage (with a 20-30 days interval period).

","Paddy stubble and leftover plants should be destroyed promptly after harvest completion. In Punjab and surrounding regions, this destruction should ideally be completed before November 15 each year. Timely destruction prevents various insect pests from surviving and multiplying in the crop residues.
The yellow stem borer and pink stem borer larvae remain protected inside leftover stems. These borers cause dead hearts in young plants and white ear heads in mature crops during subsequent seasons. Leaf folder larvae also survive in crop residues, hiding within folded leaves where they damage plants by scraping green tissue.
Planthoppers, including the brown plant hopper and white-backed plant hopper, take shelter in stubble. These sap-sucking insects not only weaken plants but also transmit dangerous viral diseases. Heavy infestations lead to hopper burn symptoms. Armyworm caterpillars feed on remaining plant material before moving to new crops, capable of rapid defoliation. Rice hispa beetles and their grubs survive in stubble, causing characteristic white streaks on leaves of new plants. You can do deep ploughing to 10-12 inch depth, which completely buries stubble and associated pests. Chemical options involve spraying glyphosate at 10 ml/liter or paraquat at 5 ml/liter on standing stubble within one week post-harvest. These applications kill pests and prevent regrowth.",,"CRITICAL SAFETY ERROR: The Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) of 70-78 days is incorrect for the post-emergence herbicides listed.

Dange,"There are several caterpillar pests that attack paddy crops in the Punjab region, including leaf folders, stem borers, and armyworms. These pests cause damage by feeding on leaves, stems, and developing grains. For controlling it, you should choose resistant varieties like PR 126 and PR 121, which show good tolerance to leaf folders. PAU 1509 basmati also demonstrates some natural resistance to leaf folder attacks. In chemical control you can use flubendiamide 20% WG, which is effective at 0.3 ml/liter of water (60-80 ml/acre). Also, you can use chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC, which works at 0.3 ml/liter or 60-80 ml/acre with a 7-12 day interval period.
Stem borer resistant options include PR 124 and HKR 47 hybrids. These varieties develop stronger stems that deter larval entry. You can use Cartap hydrochloride 4% GR granules, which should be broadcast at 10-12 kg/acre.

The disease, caused by the fungus Fusarium fujikuroi, is first visible in the nursery and becomes more apparent in the main field. The key symptoms are: The most characteristic symptom is the unusual elongation of seedlings that become much taller than the healthy plants in the same field. Thin Stems and Pale Leaves: Infected plants are often thin, weak, and have pale green leaves. The base of the stem often develops adventitious (extra) roots just above the ground level. As the disease progresses, the base of the plant stem rots, leading to the death of the plant. To control this disease, do seed treatment with Tebuconazole 50% + Trifloxystrobin 25% WG @ 2 g per kg of seeds.

It's a grain disease that doesn't destroy the whole crop but can severely impact the quality and market price of your paddy. ""Ghanda Rog"" is caused by the fungus Tilletia barclayana. The infection happens in a specific way and at a particular time. They infect the individual flowers, entering the developing grain. Inside, the fungus grows and replaces the grain's starchy content with its own black, powdery spores. The infection occurs during the flowering stage of the paddy crop (panicle emergence). The disease thrives in cool, cloudy, and drizzly weather with high humidity, which is common in Punjab during late August and September. Overuse of Nitrogen (Urea) fertilizer makes the crop more susceptible. Control for ""Ghanda Rog"" is purely preventive. Once you see the black grains in the panicle, it is too late to do anything. The spray must be done at the flowering stage to protect the grains from getting infected. The timing of the spray is the most crucial factor for effective control.

It is formulated to target and kill specific weeds without harming the wheat crop when used as directed. Its effectiveness stems from a combination of two active ingredients, Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl + Metribuzin. Accord Plus is used for the post-emergence control of problematic weeds in wheat, which compete with the crop for nutrients, water, and sunlight, thereby reducing yield. It is particularly effective against Grassy Weeds: Notably Gulli Danda or Canary Grass (Phalaris minor), a major weed in wheat cultivation. It also controls wild oats (Avena fatua). Broadleaf Weeds: It is effective against a variety of broadleaf weeds, such as Chenopodium album (Bathu), Melilotus spp. (Senji), and others. The recommended dosage of Accord Plus is 500 ml per acre. Accord Plus should be applied at the post-emergence stage of the weeds, typically 30 to 35 days after sowing the wheat crop. It is often recommended to apply it after the first irrigation when the weeds are actively growing and have 3-4 leaves. Wear appropriate protective gear, including gloves, masks, and full-sleeved clothing, while handling and spraying the herbicide.

The symptoms of iron deficiency are very distinct and almost always appear on the youngest or newly emerged leaves first. The most classic symptom is the yellowing of the leaf tissue between the veins, while the veins themselves remain green. This gives the leaves a striped or netted appearance. In severe cases, the entire leaf, including the veins, will turn yellow and may eventually become paper-white. Affected plants will be stunted, with reduced height and fewer tillers (side shoots). The deficiency is often first observed in the paddy nursery, where seedlings will look pale yellow and weak. If not corrected, the seedlings may die. If you know your field has a history of iron deficiency, you can apply Ferrous Sulphate to the soil. Apply 10 kg of Ferrous Sulphate per acre. Mix the Ferrous Sulphate with sand or dry soil for even distribution and broadcast it in the field before transplanting or at the time of final puddling.

The symptoms of zinc deficiency are quite distinct and usually appear on the younger leaves first. Small, scattered, reddish-brown spots (like rust) appear on the lower part of the younger leaves. These spots enlarge and merge, and the entire leaf takes on a bronze or dusty brown color. Eventually, the affected leaves dry up and die. The plant's growth is severely restricted, leading to a stunted and unhealthy appearance. Tillering (the growth of side shoots) is significantly reduced. In the field, you'll notice uneven growth, with patches of stunted, unhealthy-looking plants. The crop's maturity is often delayed, leading to a longer duration in the field. Zinc deficiency isn't always because the soil lacks zinc, but often because the zinc is unavailable for the plant to absorb. To control zinc deficiency in paddy, you can use a preventive Measure (Soil Application): This is the best long-term solution for fields with a known history of zinc deficiency.

First thing is, always get your soil tested from PAU or KVK lab, that way you will know what exactly your land needs. Before transplanting, add about 6 tonnes FYM per acre, this keeps soil alive and fertile. If you rotate paddy with wheat or pulses, the land stays healthy and pests also go down. Along with that, you can mix biofertilizers like Azospirillum or PSB with manure, this makes nutrients available easily to the plant. For chemical dose on medium soil, PAU says give 90 kg nitrogen (urea), split in three parts – one thrid at the time of  transplanting, one third at tillering after 20 days, and again one third at panicle stage around 45 days. Give 45 to 50 kg phosphorus (DAP or SSP) and 40 kg potash (MOP) only if soil test says low potash. If you are using DAP, remember it already gives some nitrogen, so cut urea accordingly. For foliar support, spray Potassium nitrate 1.5% (3 kg in 200 liters water per acre) at booting stage, this helps in grain filling. Always use neem-coated urea instead of normal urea, this saves nitrogen loss and saves money. Treat seed with Carbendazim 2 gram per kg (applied only under expert guidance as it have under some restriction) or for safe you can use Trichoderma 5 g per kg or thiram 3 gram per kg of seeds to keep fungus away. Fertilizer should always go in moist soil and then give irrigation for absorption. Don’t flood field when applying urea, otherwise nutrients will wash away. In Punjab, PAU varieties like PR 126, PR 113, PR 132 are best; PR 126 needs around 90 kg N/acre, PR 132 can manage with less, about 67.5 kg N/acre.

Controlling grasshoppers (often called Tidda in Punjabi) requires an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach. First, you need to determine if the number of grasshoppers in your field is high enough to cause actual financial loss. This is called the Economic Threshold Level (ETL). You should only consider chemical control when the population reaches or exceeds: 5-10 grasshoppers per sweep with a standard insect net, or an average of 2 grasshoppers per hill. The most important step is to trim the grass on and around the field bunds. Grasshoppers lay their eggs and multiply on these grassy bunds. Keeping them clean destroys their habitat and breeding grounds. In the early stages of infestation, you can run a rope across the crop to dislodge the grasshoppers, causing them to fall into the paddy water, where many will drown. If you have monitored your field and the grasshopper population is above the ETL, you can use a chemical spray such as Quinalphos 25% EC @ 800 ml in 150-200 Litres (PHI-7-15 Days), or Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC @ 200 ml in 150-200 Litres (PHI-7-15 Days).

https://irac-online.org/modes-of-action/","Demak / Loose smut It is a seed-borne fungal disease affecting wheat crops in Punjab. The disease appears at the flowering stage, replacing grains with black powdery spores. Since the fungus grows internally within the seed, prevention through seed treatment is crucial. Several wheat varieties show resistance to loose smut in Punjab conditions, like HD 2967, which demonstrates moderate resistance against the disease. PBW 725 offers good resistance to both loose smut and rust diseases. WH 1105 shows tolerance to smut and other foliar diseases. PBW 550, recommended for Punjab, provides moderate resistance. Always use certified seeds from your retailer shop. Also, you can use Carboxin 37.5% + Thiram 37.5% WS (Vitavax Power) 2 gm/kg of seed. Tebuconazole 2% DS (Raxil 2 DS) works effectively at 1.5 gm/kg of seed, controlling both loose smut and bunt.

But currently it's banned in Punjab, so avoid its uses.For foliar spray applications, you should use 1-1.5 ml of chlorpyrifos 20% EC per liter of water for light infestation. Also, you can use it as a granular form for soil-dwelling pests. The 1.5% GR formulation should be applied at 10-12 kg per acre. These granules should be broadcast uniformly in standing water for best results against underground larvae. The first spray should be applied 20-25 days after transplanting when early pest activity appears.

This also makes your crop more susceptible to diseases and pests because when we apply excess nitrogen fertilizer to crops, the plants grow very fast and produce soft, lush, and tender leaves. These tender leaves contain more sap, amino acids, and sugars, which act like “ready food” for many sucking pests such as aphids, whiteflies, jassids, and leafhoppers, as well as for caterpillars. Because the plant tissues remain soft, pests can easily suck or chew them, and the crop becomes more attractive to attacks. Furthermore, excessive nitrogen can harm the quality of your soil by increasing its acidity and reducing its overall health over time, potentially leading to deficiencies in other vital nutrients for your crops. It can even lead to nitrate leaching, contaminating groundwater which can affect human and animal health. To prevent these issues, it is always best to base your nitrogen application on soil tests and follow the recommended doses for your specific region and wheat variety, including using balanced and integrated nutrient management with both organic and inorganic sources of nutrients.

For Urea, irrigation must be applied immediately after broadcasting to dissolve the granules and prevent significant nitrogen loss to the atmosphere.

 Irrigation decisions must always be crop-specific. In paddy, irrigation should be avoided at the time of grain ripening, since excess water at maturity delays harvest and lowers grain quality. 
In onion, over-irrigation during the maturity and bulb-drying stage should be avoided, as it reduces storability and causes rotting.
 For mustard, irrigation must not be given at the flowering and pod-maturity stage, because excess moisture encourages diseases and shattering. In most vegetables, especially cucurbits and solanaceous crops, irrigation should be avoided during flowering and immediately before harvest, as water stress or excess moisture at these stages can either reduce fruit set or affect keeping quality. 

Before harvest of crops like paddy, groundnut, onion, or sugarcane  the usual practice is to stop irrigation for 7–15 days before harvest to allow proper drying and improve quality.

The most important stage is the Crown Root Initiation (CRI) stage at 20–25 days after sowing, which is essential for root development and tillering. The second critical stage is tillering (40–45 DAS), when side shoots develop and determine the number of productive tillers. 

The jointing stage (stem elongation) also requires adequate moisture for healthy crop growth.

 Irrigation at the flowering stage ensures proper pollination and grain set, while at the grain-filling or milk/dough stage , it supports kernel development and prevents shrivelled grains. 

However, irrigation should be avoided immediately after sowing to prevent seed rotting, and also just before crop maturity, as excess moisture at this stage can reduce grain quality and delay harvesting. During cloudy days, irrigation must be avoided to prevent lodging of the crop. The next irrigation in wheat should be avoided immediately after watering until the soil moisture has been adequately utilised by the crop. 

On average, wheat needs 4–6 irrigations depending on soil type and climate, but CRI, tillering, flowering, and grain filling are considered the most critical for achieving high yield.
