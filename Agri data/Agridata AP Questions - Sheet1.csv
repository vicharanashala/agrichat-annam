In Arunachal Pradesh, farmers can grow arecanut in areas with good rainfall and well-drained loamy soil. You can go for high-yielding varieties like Mangala, Sumangala, and Mohitnagar — these give good quality nuts and perform well in this region. Apply compost or FYM @ 10–15 kg per pit before planting and keep the field weed-free in early months. While planting, keep a spacing of 2.7 meter by 2.7 meter. This helps the palm grow properly and gives about 1,370 plants per hectare. Dig pits of 60 cm × 60 cm × 60 cm, fill them with compost and topsoil, and plant during May to July, just before monsoon. Each mature arecanut plant needs 100 gram Nitrogen, 40 gram Phosphorus, and 140 gram Potassium per year. You can apply it in two splits – once before monsoon (May–June, ) and second in (September–October). Also you can add neem cake (500 gram per plant) once a year to improve soil and reduce pests. For spindle bug, use Dimethoate 30% EC 1.5 ml of Dimethoate in 1 liter of water as a drenching spray into the leaf axils and crown of the arecanut palm. For mites you can spray Wettable Sulphur (usually 80% WP or 90% WDG formulation) Mix 2.5-3.0 grams of Wettable Sulphur in 1 liter of water for per acre.

You can go for high-yielding varieties like Mangala, Sumangala, and Mohitnagar — these give good quality nuts and perform well in this region. Apply compost or FYM @ 10–15 kg per pit before planting and keep the field weed-free in early months. While planting, keep a spacing of 2.7 meter by 2.7 meter. This helps the palm grow properly and gives about 1,370 plants per hectare. Dig pits of 60 cm × 60 cm × 60 cm, fill them with compost and topsoil, and plant during May to July, just before monsoon. Each mature arecanut plant needs 100 gram Nitrogen, 40 gram Phosphorus, and 140 gram Potassium per year. You can apply it in two splits – once before monsoon (May–June, ) and second in (September–October). Also you can add neem cake (500 gram per plant) once a year to improve soil and reduce pests. For spindle bug, use Dimethoate 30% EC 1.5 ml of Dimethoate in 1 liter of water as a drenching spray into the leaf axils and crown of the arecanut palm, apply Dimethoate carefully and ensure a Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) of at least 7 days is followed as per label instructions to avoid residue issues.

For best results, you can go for certified high-yielding varieties like GCH-4, DCH-177, and TMV-5, these variety are released and approved by like (GCH-4) -  Oilseeds Research Station, Gujarat Agricultural University (GAU) and Junagadh Agricultural University (JAU), (DCH-177) -  ICAR–Directorate of Groundnut Research (DGR) and and the Indian Institute of Oilseeds Research (IIOR), (TMV-5) - State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) like Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU). These varieties are tested under All India Coordinated Research Project on Groundnut (AICRP-G) and recommended for specific zones after multi-location trials. These variety these give good yield, resist most diseases, and perform well under local conditions. For planting, keep a spacing of 90 cm between rows and 60 cm between plants — this gives good air and light, which reduces disease. You'll need about 10 to 12 kg of seed per acre, and the right time to sow is May to July, just before or with the early rains. Before sowing, if you mix 5 tonnes of well-rotted FYM or compost per acre in your land, then the soil becomes soft and holds more moisture, which helps sprouting. For fertilizer, you can give 40 kg Nitrogen, 20 kg Phosphorus, and 20 kg Potash per acre, split into two doses — half at sowing, half after 30-35 days after sowing. Early weed control is very important —so you can spray as a pre emergence Pendimethalin 30% EC @ 1 litre mixed in 200 to 250 litres of water per acre and spray within 2 days of sowing to stop weeds before they grow. Insects like semilooper and capsule borer can damage leaves and pods, these are most common pest in castor.

To control it use Mancozeb 75% WP @ 600 gram per acre, mixed in 200 litres of water. For control wilt disease, always treat your seed before sowing with Carbendazim 50% WP @ 2 gram in 1 litre of water for every 10 kg of seeds – this saves the plant right from the start. You can harvest when the pods dry and turn brown, usually around 120–140 days. Don’t wait too long or the pods may burst and you’ll lose seed.

Correction: Castor varieties are developed by ICAR-Indian Institute of Oilseeds Research (ICAR-IIOR), Hyderabad, NOT by the Directorate of Groundnut Research. Groundnut Research deals with groundnut varieties, not castor.

2. Variety Verification Issues
Partially Correct but Incomplete:

GCH-4: Correctly identified as a castor variety released in 1988
DCH-177: Correctly identified as released in 2000
TMV-5: Correctly identified as a castor variety released by TNAU in 1985

All three varieties are authentic castor varieties, but the developing institutions need correction.

3. Minor Language Issues
Grammar corrections needed:

""if you mix 5 tonnes of well-rotted FYM"" (should specify ""per acre"")

""These variety These give good yield"" (duplicate word error)

4. Missing articles in several places

6. No specific research found confirming these varieties are tested/recommended specifically for Arunachal Pradesh conditions.

In Arunachal Pradesh, farmers often face problems like flower drop, pale leaves, or small fruits, which are signs of micronutrient deficiency. To solve this, farmers can spray  multi-micronutrient mixtures which is available in local agri shops. Mix 500 grams per acre in 200 litres of clean water and spray early in the morning or late in the evening when temperature is cooler. Start spraying 30 days after transplanting, and repeat it every 15 days, at least 2 to 3 times for best result. If you can see yellowing of leaves or weak plants, you can give foliar spray Zinc Sulphate (ZnSO₄ 21%) about 0.5-1.0 kg in 200 litres of water. For flower drop or poor fruit set, use Borax (Boron) at 1.5 kg per acre  for soil application and for foilar spray 300 gram of Borax in 200 litres of water.  In case you can see pale or curling leaves, spray Magnesium Sulphate at 10 kg per acre for soil application and for foliar spray 1-2 kg of Magnesium Sulphate in 200 litres of water. All these nutrients are easily available and commonly used in Arunachal Pradesh. Do not mix these sprays with strong pesticides. Always use clean water and a fine nozzle for uniform spray. These small but timely steps can improve chilli quality, increase fruit size and colour, and help farmers earn better income from their crop.

Mix 500 grams per acre in 200 litres of clean water and spray early in the morning or late in the evening when temperature is cooler. Start spraying 30 days after transplanting, and repeat it every 15 days, at least 2 to 3 times for best result. If you can see yellowing of leaves or weak plants, you can give foliar spray Zinc Sulphate (ZnSO₄ 21%) about 0.5-1.0 kg in 200 litres of water. For flower drop or poor fruit set, use Borax (Boron) at 1.5 kg per acre  for soil application and for foilar spray 0.1–0.2% (100–200 gram) of Borax in 200 litres of water.  In case you can see pale or curling leaves, spray Magnesium Sulphate at 10 kg per acre for soil application and for foliar spray 1-2 kg of Magnesium Sulphate in 200 litres of water. All these nutrients are easily available and commonly used in Arunachal Pradesh. Do not mix these sprays with strong pesticides. Always use clean water and a fine nozzle for uniform spray.

Impractical Dosage: The chemical doses for the soil drench are given as a concentration (e.g., ""10 ml in 10 litres of water""). This is a good start, but an expert answer must also specify the volume of the prepared solution to be applied per palm. For a soil drench, this is typically 15-20 litres of the solution, applied to the root zone of each affected palm.

Several sources shows these are distinct schemes with different implementation structures. ANBY has a 45% government contribution + 45% bank loan + 10% farmer contribution model. Mixing them provides incorrect financial guidance to farmers

- Claims ""50% subsidy for general category farmers"" which appears to reverse the typical subsidy pattern.
Generally, SC/ST/women farmers receive higher subsidies (50-60%) while general category receives standard rates (40-45%).

- States farmers can apply through ""Chief Minister's Dashboard Portal"" for scheme benefits.
The CM Dashboard is primarily a monitoring tool, not an application portal. Direct farmers to District Horticulture Office or designated application centers.

Right now, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) doesn’t cover mushroom, but you can still protect your investment through Agriculture Insurance Company of India (AIC) and some private insurers who offer Mushroom Crop Insurance in select districts. This insurance covers loss from diseases (like green mould, bacterial blotch), equipment failure (like humidity/temperature control), and natural calamities. Premium rates depend on your setup size, but generally small farmers pay around ₹300 to ₹2,000 per crop cycle, and the rest is supported by the scheme or company plan. To apply, talk to your District Agriculture Office, KVK, or a lead bank like SBI or Arunachal Pradesh Rural Bank. Take along your land ownership or lease papers, shed or room details, and your mushroom production records. Insure before spawning starts. If a disaster happens, you’ll get compensation quickly—so you can restart without a big loss. For keeping your mushroom rooms clean and disease-free, you have a couple of approved options. For a strong disinfection, use Formalin 37–40% at the correct dose of 2 litres per 100 litres of water. A safer and common alternative you can use 2–4% Bleaching Powder solution (that's 2–4 kg of powder in 100 litres of water). Both of these are approved for use. After disinfecting the room, it is absolutely essential to keep it sealed for 24-48 hours, and then ventilate it completely for several days before you introduce any mushroom spawn. Insurance plus clean production methods—that’s the safest way to keep your income stable, especially in hill climate where one bad batch can wipe everything out.",https://nhb.gov.in/ / https://www.arunachalplan.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Horticulture.pdf/ https://nhb.gov.in/writereaddata/082825102800MIDH%20Guideline%202025.pdf,"Mushroom farming in Arunachal Pradesh is growing fast, but like any crop, it faces risks like sudden weather change, contamination, pests, or market slowdown. Many farmers think crop insurance is the first step, but  in reality, mushroom insurance is very rare here—only a few districts in India have it, and most places in Arunachal don’t. So, don’t waste time searching for a policy that may not exist locally. Instead, the most important and reliable support for new mushroom growers is the government subsidy for building your mushroom shed. Under the National Horticulture Mission (NHM)—active in Arunachal Pradesh—you can get 40% (for general category farmers) to 50% subsidy (SC/ST farmers) on the total cost of setting up a low-cost mushroom production unit. This includes racks, shelves, and other essential infrastructure.

An expert must clarify that while such policies exist in some parts of India, they are often very rare or completely unavailable in many districts, especially in hilly states like Arunachal Pradesh. Presenting this as a primary option could give the farmer false hope and lead to a frustrating search for a product that doesn't exist locally.

Missing the Most Important and Available Subsidy: The answer completely omits the most crucial and widely accessible form of government financial support for a new mushroom grower. An expert answer must prioritize the subsidy available for the construction of the mushroom growing unit/shed itself.

Missing Correct Scheme Information: The advice would be perfect if it included the correct, actionable information. It should state that under the National Horticulture Mission (NHM), which is active in Arunachal Pradesh, a farmer can get a significant subsidy (typically 40% to 50% of the project cost) for building a low-cost mushroom production unit, including the racks and other essential infrastructure. The primary government official to contact to apply for this infrastructure subsidy is the District Horticulture Officer (DHO).

Farmers can get financial help for polyhouse structures, drip irrigation, shade nets, and nursery tools. Repayment period is flexible, and interest is lower than normal bank loans. To apply, farmers need land papers, a project report, and quotation from greenhouse suppliers. Farmers can also apply or check details through the Agri Infra Fund portal (www.agriinfra.dac.gov.in).

Should clearly state farmers pay ""effective 4% interest rate"" (7% base rate minus 3% government subvention under AIF scheme).
Because NABARD AIF provides a 3% interest subvention on the base rate of 7%, making the effective rate 4% for farmers. Multiple banking sources confirm this structure. The term ""subsidy"" confuses farmers about their actual payment obligation.

- Mixing different scheme benefits - NABARD AIF with MIDH subsidy percentages in the same sentence.
Separate NABARD AIF (which provides loans) from MIDH (which provides subsidies). AIF gives up to 85-90% financing, while MIDH provides 40-50% subsidy.
These are different schemes with different objectives. AIF focuses on infrastructure financing while MIDH provides horticultural subsidies. Mixing them confuses farmers about eligibility and benefits

Before planting, plough and cross-till the soil using traditional tools to create a fine seedbed. Apply well-decomposed organic manure or farmyard compost to maintain soil fertility. Prepare small raised nurseries in June to raise seedlings. Seedlings should be transplanted after 25 to 30 days into the terraced fields in July. After transplanting, a water level of 3 to 5 cm should be maintained. Use bamboo pipes or small earthen canals to provide irrigation from nearby streams to the fields. Remove weeds by hand, and control pests naturally or with traditional methods. In some places, farmers also raise fish in the paddy fields, which helps to control pests and gives extra income. Raising fish in the paddy fields can help control pests and provide additional income.

Fails to Answer ""Where to Get It?"": The answer describes the pump but completely omits the practical information of where a farmer in Arunachal Pradesh can purchase this specific model. An expert answer must include guidance on checking with local agricultural machinery dealers in nearby towns or looking at verified online agri-tech platforms that deliver to the region.

Missing Subsidy Information: The most valuable piece of information for a farmer is completely missing. The answer fails to mention any government subsidy schemes. An expert must connect the product to the financial support available. The advice should be to check if this type of petrol water pump is eligible for a subsidy under state or central schemes like the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) - Per Drop More Crop, and guide the farmer to contact their local District Agriculture Officer (DAO) for information on how to apply.",,"The KK-WPP-21 is a petrol-powered water pump equipped with a 2.3 kW (3.1 hp), 4-stroke, air-cooled engine and has a displacement of 163 cc.

Black tip is caused due to boron deficiency and toxic fumes (like Sulphur Dioxide) from brick kilns, to control this spray Borax (1%) before flowering and ensuring the orchard is at a safe distance from brick kilns.",FALSE,"Dangerously Incorrect Chemical Doses: The most critical flaw is the recommended dose for NAA at 200 ppm (0.2 gram per litre of water) for malformation. This is a massive overdose of the active ingredient and is likely to cause severe phytotoxicity, damaging the tree's new growth instead of helping it. The correct dose is much lower, typically using a commercial formulation like Planofix (which contains NAA 4.5 SL) at a rate of 1 ml per 4.5 litres of water. Similarly, recommending the herbicide 2,4-D for fruit drop is very risky, as misapplication can cause severe crop damage.

Incomplete Diagnosis for Black Tip: The answer mentions Black Tip but fails to explain its primary cause, which is crucial for effective management. An expert answer must state that Black Tip is primarily caused by a Boron deficiency, which is made much worse by the toxic fumes (like Sulphur Dioxide) from brick kilns. The main control measure is a spray of Borax (1%) before flowering and ensuring the orchard is at a safe distance from brick kilns.

Impractical Recommendations: The advice uses scientific terms like ""ppm"" and ""Alar,"" which are not practical for a farmer. An expert must always translate these into names of commercially available products and provide a simple, practical mixing instruction in ml or grams per litre of water.",,"The main physiological disorders of mango include alternate bearing ( heavy fruiting one year followed by poor yield the next), black tip(fruit’s tip turns yellow then brown to black and drop prematurely), spongy tissue(soft, off-flavour, pale-yellow pulp inside fruit), fruit drop(fall of fruits in early stage), fruit cracking, jelly seed(soft fruit, watery jelly like), and mango malformation(stunted shoots and flowers that stay green but give no fruits).

PM-KISAN doesn't give caste-based subsidy- the benefit is for all eligible farmers regardless of caste, as long as the land is in their name. The scheme ensures that farmers get some financial support regularly so that they can make timely decisions in farming, avoid borrowing from moneylenders, and improve their income slowly. Farmers are advised to keep land records updated, Aadhaar and bank details correct, and follow up with the department if payment delays occur. This scheme gives big support for farmers to do farming without depending on others.",

To save the crop, farmers can follow an integrated wild boar management method by using a mix of simple farming practices, homemade tools, safe repellents, and natural ways. First, don’t grow maize close to forest areas. Plant thorny bushes like agave or cactus on the field border to stop animals. Use early-growing maize varieties like Bio-9621 or HQPM-1 and harvest on time—don’t wait after the cob gets dry. In the off-season, avoid growing maize again and again in the same land. Grow ginger or turmeric instead, which wild boars don’t like. For protection at night, put solar lights or sound-making tins tied with wire that make noise when animals enter. Also, hang old cloths dipped in a mix of 1 litre used engine oil and 1 litre creosote on ropes around the field—this strong smell helps keep wild boars away. Reapply every 7 days for better result. For chemical control, spray Trinexapac-ethyl 5% EC at 300 ml per acre in 200 litres of water along the field border and boar entry points. As an alternatively, you can apply Capsaicin-based paste at the dose of 2.5 kg per acre. Mix it with a small amount of water to make a thick paste, then apply it on cloth strips, wooden sticks, or fence poles placed around the field borders and known wild boar entry points. Reapply every 10–12 days or after rainfall for continued effect. Both are safe, not harmful to animals. You can also grow lemongrass or marigold on bunds—the strong smell helps drives away wild boars. Burning cow dung cakes mixed with neem leaves at night in the field corners also helps.

Correction: Trinexapac-ethyl is a plant growth regulator and not registered or effective as a wild-boar repellent. Remove this recommendation. Check Once
Only registered repellents (e.g., garlic-oil based, castor-oil based) approved by the Central Insecticide Board & Registration Committee should be recommended; plant regulators have no repellent action.

Correction: Replace with cloth strips soaked in approved synthetic animal repellent (e.g., garlic-oil formulation at label dose) re-applied every 7–10 days.
Used engine oil and creosote are toxic, not farmer-friendly or legally permitted; commercial repellents are safe, readily available, and officially recommended.

This condition requires immediate veterinary care, including draining and antibiotics. Proper hygiene during castration is the best way to prevent this infection; disinfection of instruments and using iodine tincture on the wound are essential for prevention. Sometimes, the swelling is simply bruising or a hematoma from an injury. This may appear as a discolored, soft, and painful lump after trauma. These injuries often heal on their own if the piglet is kept in a safe pen. In other cases, the swelling could be a bacterial abscess. An abscess is a firm pocket of pus that feels soft in the center when mature. A veterinarian should lance, drain, and disinfect an abscess properly. It is very important to observe the piglet's overall behavior. If the piglet is nursing, active, and not in pain, monitoring may be suitable.

Maggot wounds are painful, so a stressed animal might injure itself or you. You'll need to clean the wound thoroughly. Start by gently removing the maggots. You can use a stick or forceps to pick them out, or pour a solution of turpentine oil or a ready-made commercial veterinary fly repellent into the wound, which will make the maggots come out. After removing the maggots, clean the area with an antiseptic solution like a diluted Dettol or Savlon solution, or even just clean, warm water. Be sure to remove all dirt, dead tissue, and any remaining maggots. Next, you need to apply a good quality wound dressing. Look for a veterinary ointment or spray that is specifically designed to kill maggots and repel flies. Products containing compounds like ivermectin or permethrin are very effective. You can also use a natural remedy by mixing neem oil with turmeric powder and applying it to the wound. Neem is a natural fly repellent and antiseptic, and turmeric helps in healing. Apply this mixture or the commercial product generously to the wound. Finally, you must dress the wound properly to prevent re-infestation. You can use a clean cloth or bandage to cover the wound.

The first and most crucial step is to immediately isolate the affected animal to prevent the virus from spreading to the entire herd. You must contact your local veterinarian or government animal health authorities to report the disease,as it is often legally mandatory. While waiting for professional guidance,provide a soft, deep, and dry bedding area for the animal to lie down. This clean bedding is essential to keep dirt and manure away from the painful foot lesions and prevent severe bacterial infections. Offer the animal soft and highly palatable feed,such as fresh green grass, soft hay, or soaked concentrates. Chewing hard feed is extremely painful due to the mouth blisters,and the animal may refuse to eat. Ensure continuous access to clean,fresh water to prevent dehydration caused by excessive drooling and reluctance to drink. To manage mouth lesions,gently rinse the animal's mouth with a mild and soothing antiseptic solution. A common and effective rinse can be made with a weak salt water solution. This helps keep the ruptured blisters clean and promotes healing. For foot lesions,carefully clean the affected hoof and foot with the same mild antiseptic solution.

The main rearing pond must be fully prepared and ready to receive the new stock. A significant difference in temperature can cause thermal shock,leading to massive mortality. The process of acclimatizing the fingerlings to the new water conditions is absolutely essential. The first step is to gradually mix the water from the main pond with the water in the fingerlings'transport container. This slow mixing should be done over a period of 15 to 30 minutes.

Ticks and lice can easily transfer through direct contact or via a contaminated environment. You must thoroughly clean and disinfect the pig's original living area after moving it. Next,you should consult a veterinarian for a precise diagnosis and treatment plan. A veternary can confirm the type of parasites and prescribe the most effective and safe treatment product. They can also rule out any secondary health issues caused by the infestation,such as anemia or skin infections. Treatment typically involves the application of a parasiticide,which is a medication that kills parasites. These medicines come in several forms,including pour-on solutions, injectables, and sprays. It is absolutely vital that you use a product specifically labeled for use in pigs. The dosage must be calculated based on the pig's body weight to be both effective and safe. You must carefully read and follow all the instructions on the product label. Pay close attention to the withdrawal period,which is the required time between treatment and when the pig can be slaughtered for meat. Treat all pigs that have been in contact with the infested animal,even if they show no signs yet. This ensures you eliminate the entire population of parasites and prevent immediate re-infestation. Alongside treating the pig,you must also treat its environment. Ticks can hide in cracks,woodpiles, and bedding, while lice eggs can be attached to pen walls and feeders. Remove all old bedding and dispose of it properly. Thoroughly scrub and spray the pen,walls, and equipment with a recommended insecticide. Repeat the environmental cleaning as advised on the insecticide label to kill any newly hatched parasites. Provide supportive care to the infested pig to help it recover. Ensure it has a clean,dry, and comfortable place to rest. Offer a highly nutritious diet with adequate iron and protein to help it recover from any blood loss. Preventing future infestations is just as important as treating the current one. Conduct regular health checks on your pigs,looking closely through their hair for signs of parasites.

A veterinarian can confirm the type of parasites and prescribe the most effective and safe treatment product. They can also rule out any secondary health issues caused by the infestation, such as anemia or skin infections. Treatment typically involves the application of a parasiticide, which is a medication that kills parasites. These medicines come in several forms, including pour-on solutions, injectables, and sprays. It is absolutely vital that you use a product specifically labeled for use in pigs. The dosage must be calculated based on the pig's body weight to be both effective and safe. You must carefully read and follow all the instructions on the product label. Pay close attention to the withdrawal period, which is the required time between treatment and when the pig can be slaughtered for meat. Treat all pigs that have been in contact with the infested animal, even if they show no signs yet. This ensures you eliminate the entire population of parasites and prevent immediate re-infestation. Alongside treating the pig, you must also treat its environment. Ticks can hide in cracks, woodpiles, and bedding, while lice eggs can be attached to pen walls and feeders. Remove all old bedding and dispose of it properly. Thoroughly scrub and spray the pen, walls, and equipment with a recommended insecticide. Repeat the environmental cleaning as advised on the insecticide label to kill any newly hatched parasites. Provide supportive care to the infested pig to help it recover. Ensure it has a clean, dry, and comfortable place to rest. Offer a highly nutritious diet with adequate iron and protein to help it recover from any blood loss. Preventing future infestations is just as important as treating the current one. Conduct regular health checks on your pigs, looking closely through their hair for signs of parasites. Maintain clean, dry, and uncrowded living conditions for your animals. Consider using approved preventive parasite control measures as part of your routine herd management.

Dange,"In Arunachal Pradesh, maggot infestation also known as myiasis or fly strike is a serious  painful condition. The first step is to isolate the infected goat from the rest of the herd immediately. This allows you to treat the animal without stressing it further and prevents the spread of flies to others. You must carefully assess the extent of the infestation by examining the affected area,which is often the rear end, wounds, or soiled skin. The next crucial step is to carefully remove all the maggots from the goat's skin and tissue. This process requires great care to avoid causing more pain or damage. You will need to clip or shave the hair from around the infested area to see clearly and allow for proper cleaning. The maggots must be physically removed using tweezers or forceps. After physical removal,the area must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. A common and effective solution for flushing out deep maggots is hydrogen peroxide. It helps to kill remaining maggots and clean the wound through its bubbling action. After rinsing with peroxide,the wound should be cleaned again with a mild antiseptic solution like diluted betadine or chlorhexidine. It is absolutely essential to consult a veterinarian as soon as possible. A veterinariant can prescribe appropriate medications that are critical for recovery. They will likely prescribe a topical insecticide spray or ointment specifically designed to kill maggots. The veterinarian will also prescribe a course of antibiotics to combat the severe bacterial infection that always accompanies maggot wounds. Injectable pain relief and anti-inflammatory medication are also very important for the goat's welfare. The underlying cause of the infestation must be identified and addressed. Myiasis is often caused by soiling of the rear end from diarrhea,or by wounds from shearing, fighting, or other injuries. Preventing future infestations is just as important as treating the current one. Maintaining good hygiene in the goat's living quarters is the best prevention. This includes regularly cleaning pens and removing damp,soiled bedding. Implementing a regular worm control program is vital to prevent diarrhea that soils the tail and rear legs. You should regularly check your goats,especially during warm weather, for any signs of wounds or soiling. Treating any wound immediately with an antiseptic spray can deter flies from laying eggs.  Providing a clean,dry, and well-ventilated environment is the most effective long-term strategy for preventing fly strike.",https://www.icar.org.in/ https://nircad.icar.gov.in/ https://www.msd-animal-health.in/species/goats/ https://vikaspedia.in/agriculture/livestock/goats-and-sheep,"In Arunachal Pradesh, maggot infestation also known as myiasis or fly strike is a serious  painful condition.

The three most serious diseases of chilli reported in the region are Anthracnose/Fruit Rot (Colletotrichum capsici), Powdery Mildew (Leveillula taurica), and Leaf Curl Disease (caused by Chilli Leaf Curl Virus, transmitted by whitefly). For Anthracnose, you should use disease-free seed and treat seeds with Thiram 75 WP at 2-3 g/kg of seed before sowing. Field sanitation, crop rotation, and destruction of infected fruits are important. On disease appearance in standing crop, spray Mancozeb 75 WP at 600-800 g/acre or Propiconazole 25 EC at 200 ml/acre, repeated at 10–15 days interval if needed. For Powdery Mildew, which spreads quickly in warm and humid weather, ensure proper plant spacing and avoid excess nitrogen. On symptoms in standing crop, spray Wettable Sulphur 80 WP at 1.25-1.3 kg/acre or Hexaconazole 5 EC at 200 ml/acre, repeated after 10–12 days if disease persists. For Leaf Curl Virus, there is no direct chemical cure, so management focuses on controlling the vector whitefly. Use resistant varieties where available, remove and destroy infected plants early, and control whitefly by spraying Neem Oil 10,000 ppm (5 ml per litre of water or 1 litre/acre) or chemical insecticides like Thiamethoxam 25 WG at 40 g/acre or Imidacloprid 17.8 SL at 60-80 ml/acre, ensuring thorough coverage of the underside of leaves. Install yellow sticky traps (6–8 per acre) and maintain field sanitation to further reduce the spread. In chilli cultivation, you must always observe the Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) to ensure the produce is safe for consumption and free from harmful residues. PHI of Mancozeb 75 WP requires at least 7 days before harvest, while Propiconazole 25 EC and Hexaconazole 5 EC need a longer interval of about 14 days. Wettable Sulphur 80 WP has a shorter waiting period of around 5 days, making it safer for use closer to harvest. Among insecticides, both Thiamethoxam 25 WG and Imidacloprid 17.8 SL should not be sprayed within 7 days of harvest.","https://niphm.gov.in/IPMPackages/Chilli.pdf

Ginger grows best in well-drained loamy soil rich in organic matter and under partial shade with good rainfall. Farmers usually plant ginger during April–May with the onset of pre-monsoon showers. In Arunachal Pradesh, popular high-yielding varieties include Nadia, Suprabha, Suruchi, Suravi, Varada, IISR Mahima, and IISR Rejatha. These varieties are not only high yielding but also have good rhizome quality and higher recovery of dry ginger and oil content. The average yield under good management practices is about 70–90 quintals per acre, while improved varieties like Varada and IISR Mahima can give up to 100–120 quintals per acre in the region. For sowing, use rhizome seed pieces weighing 20–25 g each, at a seed rate of about 5–6 quintals per acre. Use only healthy, disease-free rhizomes. Before planting, treat the rhizomes with Mancozeb at 3 g/kg of rhizomes by dipping them for 30 minutes and drying them in the shade. Alternatively, you can use Trichoderma viride at 5–10 g/kg as a biological seed treatment to prevent fungal diseases.

For sowing, use rhizome seed pieces weighing 20-25 g each, at a seed rate of about 5-6 quintals per acre. Use only healthy, disease-free rhizomes. Before planting, treat the rhizomes with Mancozeb at 3 g/kg of rhizomes by dipping them for 30 minutes and drying them in the shade. Alternatively, you can use Trichoderma viride at 5-10 g/kg as a biological seed treatment to prevent fungal diseases. Maintain adequate mulching for moisture conservation, and provide regular weeding and earthing-up.",

It occurs when a bird's body is unable to maintain a balance between the heat it produces and the heat it loses to the environment. Unlike mammals, chickens and other poultry do not have sweat glands, so they must rely on different mechanisms to cool themselves. A bird's body temperature is normally around 41-42°C (106-108°F). The ""thermoneutral zone"" where they are most comfortable is typically between 18-21°C. When the ambient temperature rises above this zone, the bird's thermoregulatory mechanisms are overwhelmed. The primary factors contributing to heat stress are high ambient temperature and high humidity. Direct sunlight or heat from the surrounding environment (e.g., a hot roof or floor) also adds to the heat load. Fast-growing broiler chickens have a high metabolic rate, which generates a large amount of internal body heat. This makes them particularly susceptible to heat stress. Heat stress has a wide range of negative impacts on poultry, affecting their health, welfare, and productivity, such as the most common sign. Birds open their mouths and breathe rapidly to lose heat through evaporation. This can lead to respiratory alkalosis (an imbalance in blood pH) due to excessive carbon dioxide loss. Birds hold their wings away from their bodies to increase surface area and allow for heat dissipation. They become lethargic and spend more time resting. Broilers may experience a significant drop in body weight gain due to reduced feed consumption. Heat stress can suppress the birds' immune system, making them more susceptible to infectious diseases. Meat quality can be affected, leading to reduced water-holding capacity and changes in color and texture. Managing heat stress requires a proactive approach that combines proper housing, feeding, and water management, such as ensuring excellent air circulation at the bird level to remove heat and humidity. This can be achieved with fans. Use evaporative cooling systems like foggers, misting systems, or cool pads to lower the ambient temperature, especially in the hottest hours. Insulate the roof and walls to prevent solar heat gain. Reduce the stocking density to give birds more room to move and dissipate heat. Ensure Ample, Cool Water: Provide easy access to a sufficient number of waterers. Regularly flush water lines to ensure the water is fresh and cool. Add electrolytes to the drinking water. This helps replenish minerals lost during panting and maintains the bird's hydration and acid-base balance. Feed birds during the cooler parts of the day (early morning and late evening/night). This encourages them to eat when they are less stressed. Formulate a diet that is more nutrient-dense to compensate for reduced feed intake.

The most notable cause is Pullorum Disease, a highly contagious bacterial infection. However, other conditions, such as Coccidiosis and even simple chilling, can also cause white, watery droppings. Before you can treat the condition, it's crucial to identify the root cause. A veterinarian or a poultry health expert can perform a proper diagnosis through laboratory tests. Pullorum Disease (Bacillary White Diarrhea): Caused by the bacterium Salmonella pullorum. This is a highly infectious disease that is transmitted from the hen to the chick through the egg. It can cause high mortality rates (80-100%) in chicks. Coccidiosis: Caused by a protozoan parasite, Eimeria. While coccidiosis often causes bloody or orange-colored diarrhea, some forms can present with white, watery droppings. Chilling, poor feed quality, or other bacterial infections can also result in white diarrhea. The treatment approach depends entirely on the cause. It is essential to consult with a veterinarian before administering any medication, as using the wrong drug can be ineffective and contribute to antibiotic resistance. Treatment for Pullorum Disease: While some antibiotics (such as furazolidone, chloramphenicol, and others) can reduce mortality, they are generally not recommended as a primary treatment. This is because the goal is not to ""cure"" the birds but to eradicate the disease from the flock. The standard and most effective method for controlling Pullorum Disease is to depopulate the infected flock. This is because birds that survive the infection will become ""carriers"" and continue to spread the bacteria to other birds, especially through their eggs, making the problem chronic. A strict biosecurity protocol is the most important measure to prevent Pullorum. This includes: Sourcing chicks from hatcheries certified to be Pullorum-free, testing breeding flocks for the presence of the bacteria, strict hygiene, and disinfection of all equipment and houses. Treatment for Coccidiosis: If coccidiosis is the cause, specific anticoccidial drugs (like amprolium or sulfa drugs) are administered through drinking water. Provide electrolytes and multivitamins in the water to help the birds recover from dehydration and to support their immune systems. Coccidiosis is often a result of poor hygiene. Keeping the litter dry and clean is crucial for preventing and controlling outbreaks. Regardless of the specific cause, the following management practices are crucial for both treatment and prevention of white diarrhea: As soon as you see a bird with white diarrhea, isolate it from the rest of the flock to prevent the spread of the disease. Provide fresh, clean drinking water at all times. Maintain dry, clean litter. Wet litter is a breeding ground for bacteria and parasites.

The most notable cause is pullorum disease, a highly contagious bacterial infection. However, other conditions, such as coccidiosis and even simple chilling, can also cause white, watery droppings. Before you can treat the condition, it's crucial to identify the root cause. A veterinarian or a poultry health expert can perform a proper diagnosis through laboratory tests. Pullorum Disease (Bacillary White Diarrhea): Caused by the bacterium Salmonella pullorum. This is a highly infectious disease that is transmitted from the hen to the chick through the egg. It can cause high mortality rates (80-100%) in chicks. Coccidiosis: Caused by a protozoan parasite, Eimeria. While coccidiosis often causes bloody or orange-colored diarrhea, some forms can present with white, watery droppings. Chilling, poor feed quality, or other bacterial infections can also result in white diarrhea. The treatment approach depends entirely on the cause. It is essential to consult with a veterinarian before administering any medication, as using the wrong drug can be ineffective and contribute to antibiotic resistance. Treatment for Pullorum Disease:While some antibiotics can reduce mortality, they are generally not recommended as a primary treatment. This is because the goal is not to ""cure"" the birds but to eradicate the disease from the flock. The standard and most effective method for controlling pullorum disease is to depopulate the infected flock.

The three major types of rice grown are Ahu, Boro, and Sali rice. Ahu Rice (Pre-monsoon Rice) is the early rice grown during March to June in upland and midland areas, using pre-monsoon showers. It matures early and provides food before the main season crop. Popular varieties are RCPL 1-10, RCM 9, and Naveen, giving an average yield of 12–15 quintals/acre. Boro Rice (Winter Rice) is grown in November to May in areas where irrigation is available, especially in valleys and low-lying fields. It is transplanted in December–January and harvested in April–May. Suitable varieties include Bahadur, Pooja, and CAU-R1, with yields of about 15–18 quintals/acre. Sali Rice (Kharif/Main Season Rice) is the major rice crop, grown during the monsoon season (June–November) under rainfed lowland and irrigated conditions. It is transplanted in July–August and harvested in October–November. High-yielding varieties recommended for Sali season are RCM 10, RCM 11, RCM 13, Luit, Rajalaxmi which can yield 18–22 quintals/acre. You should prepare your field thoroughly by ploughing and puddling it 3-4 times. This creates a soft mud that is ideal for transplanting seedlings and also helps to control weeds. For better growth, apply FYM/compost at 4–5 tonnes per acre before puddling. For cultivation of paddy in upland use 79 kg urea, 348 kg Single Superphosphate (SSP) and 49 kg Muriate of Potash (MOP) in per acre area.  For cultivation of paddy in lowland and hilly region use 88 kg urea , 348 kg Single Superphosphate (SSP) and 49 kg Muriate of Potash (MOP) in per acre area. For nursery raising, about 20–25 kg of seed per acre is sufficient. Seeds should be treated with Mancozeb 75 WP at 2.5–3 g/kg of seed before sowing to protect against seed-borne diseases. Seedlings of 20–25 days age are ideal for transplanting in puddled fields, keeping a spacing of 20 x 15 cm for better tillering and weed management.",https://www.researchgate.net/publication/365489083_RICE-CULTIVATION-AND-NEED-OF-COLD-TOLERANCE-BREEDING-IN-EAST-AND-NORTH-EAST-INDIA,"Paddy is the most important staple food crop of Arunachal Pradesh, and because of the state’s rainfall pattern and hilly climate, farmers cultivate different types of rice depending on the season.

It's a sign that something is irritating the respiratory system. Therefore, effective treatment depends on accurately identifying the underlying cause. A veterinarian's diagnosis is crucial, as treating the wrong condition can be ineffective and harmful. Common Causes of Coughing in Goats: Dusty or moldy hay, ammonia buildup from poor ventilation and soiled bedding, dust in the air from dry conditions or poor pen design. Goats can become infected with lungworms (e.g., Dictyocaulus filaria) by ingesting larvae from contaminated pastures. The larvae migrate to the lungs, causing irritation and a persistent cough. Bacterial Infections (Pneumonia) this is a serious cause of coughing, especially in young or stressed goats. Common bacteria include Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida. Viruses like Parainfluenza type 3 (PI-3) or the Caprine Arthritis and Encephalitis (CAE) virus can lead to a cough, which may also predispose the goat to secondary bacterial infections. Stress from transportation, overcrowding, or sudden weather changes can weaken a goat's immune system, making it more susceptible to respiratory illnesses.  While less common, goats can have allergic reactions to certain feeds or environmental factors, leading to a cough. To treat the goats, identify and eliminate the irritant. If the cause is dusty hay, switch to a cleaner source. If it's ammonia, improve ventilation in the barn and change the bedding more frequently, and provide clean, fresh air. Ensure the goat's living space has good airflow without direct drafts. 2. Parasitic Infections (Lungworms): Deworming: This is the primary treatment. A veterinarian can conduct a fecal test to confirm the presence of lungworms and recommend an effective dewormer (anthelmintic). Common medications include ivermectin or other broad-spectrum dewormers. Pasture Management: To prevent re-infection, rotate pastures to break the parasite life cycle. 3. Bacterial Infections (Pneumonia): Veterinary Consultation: This is a medical emergency. You must contact a veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. A vet will likely listen to the goat's lungs and may take its temperature. The veterinarian will prescribe an antibiotic based on the specific bacteria identified or suspected. Commonly used antibiotics for goat pneumonia include penicillin, oxytetracycline, or ceftiofur. It is crucial to complete the full course of antibiotics as prescribed to prevent a relapse and the development of antibiotic resistance. Or you can provide supportive care, such as providing a warm, dry, and well-ventilated space for the sick goat, isolated from the rest of the herd to prevent disease spread. Encourage fluid intake. Offer high-quality, easily digestible feed. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be prescribed by a vet to reduce fever and inflammation, making the goat more comfortable. Ensure the goat barn has adequate airflow to prevent the buildup of dust and ammonia. Regularly clean and replace bedding to maintain a sanitary environment. Isolate any new goats for at least two weeks before introducing them to the rest of the herd.

Bacterial Infections (Pneumonia). This is a serious cause of coughing, especially in young or stressed goats. Common bacteria include Mannheimia haemolytica and Pasteurella multocida. Viruses like Parainfluenza type 3 (PI-3) or the Caprine Arthritis and Encephalitis (CAE) virus can lead to a cough, which may also predispose the goat to secondary bacterial infections. Stress from transportation, overcrowding, or sudden weather changes can weaken a goat's immune system, making it more susceptible to respiratory illnesses.  While less common, goats can have allergic reactions to certain feeds or environmental factors, leading to a cough. To treat the goats, identify and eliminate the irritant. If the cause is dusty hay, switch to a cleaner source. If it's ammonia, improve ventilation in the barn and change the bedding more frequently, and provide clean, fresh air. Ensure the goat's living space has good airflow without direct drafts. 2. Parasitic Infections (Lungworms): Deworming: This is the primary treatment. A veterinarian can conduct a fecal test to confirm the presence of lungworms and recommend an effective dewormer (anthelmintic). Common medications include ivermectin or other broad-spectrum dewormers. Pasture Management: To prevent re-infection, rotate pastures to break the parasite life cycle. 3. Bacterial Infections (Pneumonia): Veterinary Consultation: This is a medical emergency. You must contact a veterinarian for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. A vet will likely listen to the goat's lungs and may take its temperature. The veterinarian will prescribe an antibiotic based on the specific bacteria identified or suspected. Commonly used antibiotics for goat pneumonia include penicillin, oxytetracycline, or ceftiofur. It is crucial to complete the full course of antibiotics as prescribed to prevent a relapse and the development of antibiotic resistance. Or you can provide supportive care, such as providing a warm, dry, and well-ventilated space for the sick goat, isolated from the rest of the herd to prevent disease spread. Encourage fluid intake. Offer high-quality, easily digestible feed. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be prescribed by a vet to reduce fever and inflammation, making the goat more comfortable. Ensure the goat barn has adequate airflow to prevent the buildup of dust and ammonia. Regularly clean and replace bedding to maintain a sanitary environment.

This recommendation is based on several key factors related to animal welfare, stress, and long-term health and growth. Calves are easier to handle when they are young, and their smaller size means the procedure is less traumatic. The younger the calf, the less developed the nerves and blood vessels are in the scrotum, which reduces the immediate pain and stress response. Studies have shown that calves castrated at a young age experience a shorter period of discomfort compared to those castrated later. Castrating a calf at an early age is considered a best practice for animal welfare. It's a less invasive procedure with a lower risk of complications like bleeding, infection, and chronic pain. The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) recommends performing castration at the earliest age possible, preferably before three months. A common misconception is that delaying castration allows the calf to benefit from testosterone and gain more weight before the procedure. However, research has shown that any testosterone advantage in young calves is minimal and does not significantly impact their final weaning weight. In fact, late castration (at or after weaning) can cause significant stress, a higher risk of sickness, and a setback in growth from which the calf may never fully recover. Calves castrated early often have higher average daily gains in the post-weaning period. Castrated male calves (steers) are often more valuable at auction than intact bulls. Buyers prefer steers because they are less aggressive, easier to manage in a feedlot, and produce a higher-quality carcass with better marbling and tenderness.

It refers to a cow or buffalo that has regular estrous (heat) cycles but fails to conceive after three or more consecutive inseminations with fertile semen. This condition is a significant cause of economic loss for farmers because it extends the calving interval, reduces milk production, increases the cost of breeding, and can lead to the culling of valuable animals. The causes of repeat breeding are complex and often a combination of factors. In a region like Arunachal Pradesh, which has diverse topography and specific agricultural practices, these factors can be particularly challenging. Improper Breeding Management: Farmers may fail to identify the signs of a cow in heat (estrus) or miss the optimal time for insemination. This is especially true in buffaloes, which exhibit silent or weak heat signs. The skill of the inseminator and the proper handling of frozen semen straws are critical. In rural areas, a lack of trained personnel can be a contributing factor. Using semen that has not been properly stored (i.e., cold chain not maintained) or is of poor quality can lead to fertilization failure. A lack of essential minerals (e.g., phosphorus, copper, zinc) and vitamins (especially A, E, and D) can impair the animal's reproductive system. After calving, high-producing cows may not consume enough food to meet their energy needs for milk production. This ""negative energy balance"" can delay the return to normal cycles and affect fertility. Subclinical endometritis (inflammation of the uterus) is a common cause of repeat breeding. The infection may not cause visible symptoms like vaginal discharge, but it can lead to early embryonic death. Bacteria, viruses, or even fungi can be responsible. Controlling repeat breeding in cows and buffaloes requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the various underlying causes. Here's a comprehensive plan focusing on management, nutrition, and veterinary intervention. Improve Breeding and Herd Management: Accurate Heat Detection: This is the cornerstone of a successful breeding program. Train farm staff to carefully observe animals for signs of heat, which include: Standing to be mounted by other cows. Mounting other cows. Restlessness and bellowing. Swelling and redness of the vulva. Presence of a clear, thick mucus discharge. Once a cow is in heat, the ""AM/PM rule"" is a good guideline: inseminate in the morning (AM) if signs of heat are observed the previous evening (PM), and in the evening (PM) if signs are observed in the morning (AM). Ensure the cows and buffaloes receive a diet with the correct balance of protein, energy, and fiber.  Ensure adequate levels of calcium and phosphorus, which are crucial for bone health and reproductive function. Consult with a veterinarian to identify and treat underlying health issues. Reproductive Tract Examination: For cows that are repeat breeders, have a vet perform a physical examination of the reproductive tract. This can help identify: Ovarian cysts. Anatomical defects. Signs of subclinical endometritis (uterine inflammation). Treatment of Infections: If a uterine infection is diagnosed, the vet will prescribe specific treatments, which may include: Intrauterine infusions of antibiotics. Hormonal therapies (e.g., prostaglandins) are used to cause a new cycle and help the uterus clear the infection. In cases of hormonal imbalance, a vet may administer hormones like GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) to induce ovulation or prostaglandins to bring the animal into heat. Ensure a regular deworming schedule to prevent internal parasites, which can compromise the animal's overall health and fertility. Vaccinate against reproductive diseases that can cause embryonic death or abortion. In hot climates, especially in the low-lying areas of Arunachal Pradesh, heat stress can be a significant factor. The first step is to get a professional diagnosis. They can conduct a physical exam and recommend a specific plan for your herd.

Signs of subclinical endometritis (uterine inflammation). Treatment of Infections: If a uterine infection is diagnosed, the vet will prescribe specific treatments, which may include: Intrauterine infusions of antibiotics. Hormonal therapies (e.g., prostaglandins) are used to cause a new cycle and help the uterus clear the infection. In cases of hormonal imbalance, a vet may administer hormones like GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) to induce ovulation or prostaglandins to bring the animal into heat. Ensure a regular deworming schedule to prevent internal parasites, which can compromise the animal's overall health and fertility. Vaccinate against reproductive diseases that can cause embryonic death or abortion. In hot climates, especially in the low-lying areas of Arunachal Pradesh, heat stress can be a significant factor. The first step is to get a professional diagnosis. They can conduct a physical exam and recommend a specific plan for your herd. ",TRUE,-,,"Repeat breeding is a major reproductive problem in cattle and buffaloes, which also affects livestock farming. It refers to a cow or buffalo that has regular estrous (heat) cycles but fails to conceive after three or more consecutive inseminations with fertile semen. This condition is a significant cause of economic loss for farmers because it extends the calving interval, reduces milk production, increases the cost of breeding, and can lead to the culling of valuable animals. The causes of repeat breeding are complex and often a combination of factors. In a region like Arunachal Pradesh, which has diverse topography and specific agricultural practices, these factors can be particularly challenging. Improper Breeding Management: Farmers may fail to identify the signs of a cow in heat (estrus) or miss the optimal time for insemination. This is especially true in buffaloes, which exhibit silent or weak heat signs. The skill of the inseminator and the proper handling of frozen semen straws are critical. In rural areas, a lack of trained personnel can be a contributing factor. Using semen that has not been properly stored (i.e., cold chain not maintained) or is of poor quality can lead to fertilization failure. A lack of essential minerals (e.g., phosphorus, copper, zinc) and vitamins (especially A, E, and D) can impair the animal's reproductive system. After calving, high-producing cows may not consume enough food to meet their energy needs for milk production. This ""negative energy balance"" can delay the return to normal cycles and affect fertility. Subclinical endometritis (inflammation of the uterus) is a common cause of repeat breeding. The infection may not cause visible symptoms like vaginal discharge, but it can lead to early embryonic death. Bacteria, viruses, or even fungi can be responsible. Controlling repeat breeding in cows and buffaloes requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses the various underlying causes. Here's a comprehensive plan focusing on management, nutrition, and veterinary intervention. Improve Breeding and Herd Management: Accurate Heat Detection: This is the cornerstone of a successful breeding program. Train farm staff to carefully observe animals for signs of heat, which include: Standing to be mounted by other cows. Mounting other cows. Restlessness and bellowing. Swelling and redness of the vulva. Presence of a clear, thick mucus discharge. Once a cow is in heat, the ""AM/PM rule"" is a good guideline: inseminate in the morning (AM) if signs of heat are observed the previous evening (PM), and in the evening (PM) if signs are observed in the morning (AM). Ensure the cows and buffaloes receive a diet with the correct balance of protein, energy, and fiber.

These measures primarily focus on prevention and mitigation by managing the physical, chemical, and biological parameters of the water. Regular monitoring is the foundation of water quality control. By routinely checking key parameters, you can detect problems early and take corrective action before they escalate. The ideal pH for most fish is between 6.5 and 8.5. If the water is too acidic or alkaline, it can stress the fish, damage their gills, and reduce their growth. You can adjust the pH by adding agricultural lime (calcium carbonate) to acidic water or a buffer like sodium bicarbonate to highly alkaline water. Fish need sufficient DO to survive. Low DO levels are a primary cause of fish kills. Aeration is the main control measure. This can be done by using aerators, splashboards, or paddlewheels to increase the water's surface area and facilitate oxygen transfer from the air. These compounds are produced from fish waste and uneaten feed. High levels are toxic to fish. The nitrogen cycle is the biological process that breaks them down into less harmful forms. To manage this: Avoid overfeeding to reduce waste. Maintain a healthy population of beneficial bacteria through proper aeration. Use biofilters in closed systems to provide a surface for these bacteria to colonize. Extreme temperatures, whether too high or too low, can be lethal. In warm climates, you can increase water depth, provide shade, or use water exchanges to keep temperatures down. Proper pond and farm management directly influences water quality. Do not overcrowd your ponds. A high stocking density increases the amount of fish waste, which puts a strain on the water's natural filtration capacity. Overfeeding is a common cause of water quality issues. Uneaten food decomposes and consumes dissolved oxygen while increasing ammonia levels. Feed your fish only what they can consume in a short period (10-15 minutes). Regularly drain and refill a portion of the pond water. This helps flush out accumulated waste products and replenish the water with fresh, oxygenated water. Over time, waste and uneaten food form a thick layer of sludge at the bottom of the pond. Periodically, you must remove this sediment to prevent the release of harmful gases like hydrogen sulfide. Harnessing natural processes can help maintain a balanced aquatic ecosystem. Introducing beneficial microbes (probiotics) to the water or feed can help break down organic waste, improve water quality, and even enhance the fish's immune system. While some aquatic plants can be a problem, certain types can act as natural filters, absorbing nutrients like nitrates and phosphates. However, you must manage their growth to prevent them from overgrowing and consuming too much dissolved oxygen at night. Raising different species of fish in the same pond can create a more balanced ecosystem. For example, a fish that feeds on algae can help control algal blooms, which can cause oxygen depletion when they die off.",https://fisheries.arunachal.gov.in/ https://www.dcfr.res.in/ https://nfdb.gov.in/ ,"Control measures for deteriorated water quality in fisheries are critical for maintaining healthy fish populations and ensuring the sustainability of the operation.

To manage this: Avoid overfeeding to reduce waste. Maintain a healthy population of beneficial bacteria through proper aeration. Use biofilters in closed systems to provide a surface for these bacteria to colonize. Extreme temperatures, whether too high or too low, can be lethal. In warm climates, you can increase water depth, provide shade, or use water exchanges to keep temperatures down. Proper pond and farm management directly influences water quality. Do not overcrowd your ponds. A high stocking density increases the amount of fish waste, which puts a strain on the water's natural filtration capacity. Overfeeding is a common cause of water quality issues. Uneaten food decomposes and consumes dissolved oxygen while increasing ammonia levels. Feed your fish only what they can consume in a short period (10-15 minutes). Regularly drain and refill a portion of the pond water. This helps flush out accumulated waste products and replenish the water with fresh, oxygenated water. Over time, waste and uneaten food form a thick layer of sludge at the bottom of the pond. Periodically, you must remove this sediment to prevent the release of harmful gases like hydrogen sulfide. Harnessing natural processes can help maintain a balanced aquatic ecosystem. Introducing beneficial microbes (probiotics) to the water or feed can help break down organic waste, improve water quality, and even enhance the fish's immune system. While some aquatic plants can be a problem, certain types can act as natural filters, absorbing nutrients like nitrates and phosphates. However, you must manage their growth to prevent them from overgrowing and consuming too much dissolved oxygen at night. Raising different species of fish in the same pond can create a more balanced ecosystem. For example, a fish that feeds on algae can help control algal blooms, which can cause oxygen depletion when they die off.",TRUE,-,,"Control measures for deteriorated water quality in fisheries are critical for maintaining healthy fish populations and ensuring the sustainability of the operation. These measures primarily focus on prevention and mitigation by managing the physical, chemical, and biological parameters of the water. Regular monitoring is the foundation of water quality control. By routinely checking key parameters, you can detect problems early and take corrective action before they escalate. The ideal pH for most fish is between 6.5 and 8.5. If the water is too acidic or alkaline, it can stress the fish, damage their gills, and reduce their growth. You can adjust the pH by adding agricultural lime (calcium carbonate) to acidic water or a buffer like sodium bicarbonate to highly alkaline water. Fish need sufficient DO to survive. Low DO levels are a primary cause of fish kills. Aeration is the main control measure.

The state government, in collaboration with various organizations, is actively engaged in vaccination drives and awareness programs to control and eventually eliminate rabies. For dogs, the rabies vaccine is a core vaccine, meaning it is considered essential for all dogs regardless of their lifestyle or location, especially in countries like India, where rabies is endemic. The vaccine is a preventative measure that helps a dog's immune system fight off the rabies virus if it is ever exposed. The specific vaccine used is typically an inactivated (killed) virus vaccine. This means the vaccine contains a dead form of the rabies virus that cannot cause the disease but is sufficient to trigger an immune response in the dog's body. Some common brand names for rabies vaccines for dogs available in India include: Nobivac Rabies (from Merck Animal Health), Raksharab (from Indian Immunologicals), Defensor (from Zoetis), and Rabigen. The typical vaccination schedule is as follows: First Dose: Administered to puppies at around 12-16 weeks of age. Booster Dose: A second dose may be given after 21-30 days to ensure robust immunity. Annual Booster: After the initial puppy shots, an annual booster is mandatory to maintain immunity for the dog's lifetime. The cost of a rabies vaccine in India is generally affordable, ranging from ₹160 to ₹500 per dose, depending on the clinic and the brand of vaccine. It is very important to get a vaccination card from the veterinarian after the first dose and to keep it updated with each subsequent booster. This card serves as proof of vaccination and is essential for travel or in case of a bite incident. You can get your dog vaccinated against rabies at: Government Veterinary Hospitals and Dispensaries. These are the primary points of contact and are located in various districts and towns across the state. They are often the sites for free or subsidized vaccination programs. You can find information about these centers through the local Department of Animal Husbandry or district administration offices.

Inorganic Fertilizers: Urea, Single Super Phosphate (SSP), and Muriate of Potash can be applied in monthly doses, alternating with organic manure. While natural food is important, it's often not enough to support a high stocking density, especially as the fish grow. Supplementary feeding is necessary to achieve faster growth and a better yield. The most common and locally available ingredients for carp feed are: Rice Bran: A byproduct of rice milling, rich in carbohydrates. Mustard Oil Cake: A byproduct of mustard oil extraction, providing protein. Groundnut Oil Cake or Soybean Meal: These are excellent sources of high-quality protein. A simple and effective supplementary feed can be prepared by mixing rice bran and mustard oil cake in a ratio of 1.5:1.

The natural food available in a pond is crucial for the early growth of fish, especially fry and fingerlings. Microscopic plant organisms. Zooplankton: Microscopic animal organisms. Benthic organisms: Insects, worms, and other small invertebrates living at the bottom. Detritus: Decaying organic matter. To ensure a continuous supply of this natural food, you need to fertilize the pond. The Department of Fisheries recommends a combination of organic and inorganic fertilizers. Organic Manure: Raw cattle dung, poultry litter, or pig manure are excellent sources. A recommended dose is about 600 to 800 kg per 1000 square meters of water area, applied in split doses throughout the year. This promotes the growth of the microorganisms that carp feed on. Inorganic Fertilizers: Urea, Single Super Phosphate (SSP), and Muriate of Potash can be applied in monthly doses, alternating with organic manure. While natural food is important, it's often not enough to support a high stocking density, especially as the fish grow. Supplementary feeding is necessary to achieve faster growth and a better yield. The most common and locally available ingredients for carp feed are: Rice Bran: A byproduct of rice milling, rich in carbohydrates. Mustard Oil Cake: A byproduct of mustard oil extraction, providing protein. Groundnut Oil Cake or Soybean Meal: These are excellent sources of high-quality protein. A simple and effective supplementary feed can be prepared by mixing rice bran and mustard oil cake in a ratio of 1:1. The feed should be given at one or two fixed points in the pond to avoid wastage and prevent pollution. It can be placed in perforated plastic bags or on a bamboo tray and submerged in the water. The Apatani plateau in Arunachal Pradesh is famous for its paddy-cum-fish culture, a highly sustainable and traditional practice. In this system, the fish (primarily common carp) feed on the natural food base available in the rice fields, such as plankton and periphyton that grow on the rice stems.

Parasites, both internal (like roundworms, tapeworms, and liver flukes) and external, can cause significant damage to a calf's digestive system, leading to poor nutrient absorption, stunted growth, and even death. In Arunachal Pradesh, with its diverse terrain and farming practices, a strategic deworming schedule is essential. It's important to consult a local veterinarian for a specific plan tailored to your farm's conditions. Dewormers, also known as anthelmintics, are medicines that kill or expel internal parasites. They work by targeting the parasites' nervous systems or metabolisms. They come in different forms, including oral suspensions (syrups), boluses (large tablets), and pour-ons. A scheduled deworming program is more effective than treating a calf only when it shows signs of illness. A typical schedule for calves up to six months of age is: First Deworming: At 10-15 days of age. This initial dose is primarily to target roundworms (Ascaris) that can be transmitted from the mother. Subsequent Deworming: After the first dose, deworming should be done at monthly intervals until the calf is about six months old. After Six Months, for animals older than six months, deworming can be done twice or thrice a year, often before and after the monsoon season, as the high humidity can lead to an increase in parasite eggs in the pastures. Many deworming medicines are available in India, and they are generally available as syrups or tablets (boluses). The two most common active ingredients are: 1. Albendazole: Available as both oral suspension (syrup) and bolus (tablet). It is a broad-spectrum dewormer effective against a wide range of roundworms, tapeworms, and flukes. The standard dose for calves is 5-10 mg of Albendazole per kg of body weight. For example, if a calf weighs 30 kg, you would need to give 150-300 mg of Albendazole. This can be done by using a syrup or crushing a bolus and mixing it with water. The oral suspension is often preferred for young calves as it is easier to administer. 2. Fenbendazole: Also available as a syrup, bolus, or even oral paste. It is another highly effective broad-spectrum dewormer that is considered very safe for young animals. The standard dose is 5 mg per kg of body weight. Fenbendazole is often recommended for regular deworming because of its wide safety margin. The best practice is always to consult with the District Veterinary Officer or a local veterinarian. They can provide advice specific to your farm's location and the types of parasites prevalent in the area. Deworming is only one part of parasite control.

It directly impacts fish growth, health, and the overall productivity of the pond ecosystem. The optimal stocking density is not a single number; it depends on the type of fish being cultured, the management practices, and the agro-climatic zone of the state. The Department of Fisheries, Government of Arunachal Pradesh, provides specific guidelines for farmers to follow, often as part of government schemes like the 'Atma Nirbhar Matsya Palan Yojana'. In Arunachal Pradesh, composite fish culture, which involves culturing a combination of fish species with different feeding habits, is the recommended practice. The stocking density is directly linked to the intensity of pond management. Arunachal Pradesh has distinct zones, and the recommended stocking density varies accordingly. Based on guidelines from the Department of Fisheries and other research organizations, a general stocking density for semi-intensive composite fish culture in Arunachal Pradesh is as follows: A common recommendation is 5,000 to 10,000 fingerlings per hectare (10,000 square meters).  The ratio of different species is critical for balanced growth. A common ratio might be: Surface feeders (Catla, Silver Carp): 40%, Column feeders (Rohu): 30%, Bottom feeders (Mrigal, Common Carp): 30%. In systems like paddy-cum-fish culture, the stocking density is generally lower, around 6,000-8,000 fingerlings per hectare, as the fish have less space and feed on a different natural food base. In pig-cum-fish or duck-cum-fish culture, the stocking density can be higher (up to 8,500 fingerlings/ha) as the livestock waste acts as a natural fertilizer and feed, reducing the need for other inputs. It is recommended to stock healthy, uniformly sized fingerlings (about 100 mm in size) to ensure a high survival rate and uniform growth. The pond should be properly prepared before stocking, including clearing predatory fish, liming to adjust pH, and manuring to develop a natural food base. Regular monitoring of water quality parameters like pH, dissolved oxygen, and temperature is essential. High stocking densities can lead to rapid deterioration of water quality, which can be fatal to the fish. The best advice will come from a local Fishery Extension Officer or a representative from the KVK (Krishi Vigyan Kendra).

The Department of Fisheries, Government of Arunachal Pradesh, provides specific guidelines for farmers to follow, often as part of government schemes like the 'Atma Nirbhar Matsya Palan Yojana'. In Arunachal Pradesh, composite fish culture, which involves culturing a combination of fish species with different feeding habits, is the recommended practice. The stocking density is directly linked to the intensity of pond management. Arunachal Pradesh has distinct zones, and the recommended stocking density varies accordingly. Based on guidelines from the Department of Fisheries and other research organizations, a general stocking density for semi-intensive composite fish culture in Arunachal Pradesh is as follows: A common recommendation is 5,000 to 10,000 fingerlings per hectare (10,000 square meters) (2,000-4,000 fingerlings per acre).  The ratio of different species is critical for balanced growth. A common ratio might be: Surface feeders (Catla, Silver Carp): 40%, Column feeders (Rohu): 30%, Bottom feeders (Mrigal, Common Carp): 30%. In systems like paddy-cum-fish culture, the stocking density is generally lower, around 6,000-8,000 fingerlings per hectare (2,428 to 3,238 fingerlings per acre), as the fish have less space and feed on a different natural food base. In pig-cum-fish or duck-cum-fish culture, the stocking density can be higher (3,440 fingerlings per acre.) as the livestock waste acts as a natural fertilizer and feed, reducing the need for other inputs. It is recommended to stock healthy, uniformly sized fingerlings (about 100 mm in size) to ensure a high survival rate and uniform growth. The pond should be properly prepared before stocking, including clearing predatory fish, liming to adjust pH, and manuring to develop a natural food base. Regular monitoring of water quality parameters like pH, dissolved oxygen, and temperature is essential. High stocking densities can lead to rapid deterioration of water quality, which can be fatal to the fish. The best advice will come from a local Fishery Extension Officer or a representative from the KVK (Krishi Vigyan Kendra).

If you're dealing with a gill fluke in Arunachal Pradesh, here's what you should do, categorized into immediate actions and long-term prevention. The key to treating a gill fluke infestation is to act quickly and follow a multi-pronged approach. Gill flukes often thrive in ponds with poor water quality, high organic loads, and low oxygen levels. The first step is to improve these conditions. This may involve partial water changes and ensuring proper aeration in the pond. Remove any excess feed, dead fish, or other decaying matter from the pond. This helps in reducing the breeding ground for the parasites. Check your water's pH, dissolved oxygen, and temperature. Stress from unstable water parameters can weaken the fish's immune system, making them more susceptible to parasites. A simple and effective method for small-scale infestations or for treating individual fish is to give them a salt bath. A 3-5% common salt solution for 10-15 minutes can be a good option. Potassium permanganate is a common disinfectant used in aquaculture. A bath treatment with a concentration of 4-6 ppm (mg per liter) for a short period (5-10 minutes) can be effective. Formalin (formaldehyde solution) is another common treatment. A pond treatment with 25 ppm of formalin, along with good aeration, can be used. Specialized Anti-Parasitic Medications: There are commercial anti-parasitic medications available in India that are specifically designed to combat gill and body flukes. Products containing praziquantel or other anti-helminthic agents are often recommended. Look for products like ""Misha Anti Lice & Flukes"" or ""DiscusX Fluke X"", which are specifically designed for this purpose. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for dosage and application. The best course of action is to contact a local fisheries officer or an aquatic veterinarian. They can help you with proper diagnosis, recommend the most suitable treatment for your specific situation (fish species, pond size, etc.), and provide guidance on dosages.  If possible, isolate the infected fish in a separate ""hospital tank"" to prevent the spread of the parasite to the entire population. This is particularly important for high-value fish.  To prevent future outbreaks, you need to implement good management practices. Never introduce new fish directly into your pond or tank. Always quarantine them in a separate tank for at least two weeks and treat them for any potential parasites. Disinfect all new equipment (nets, buckets, etc.) before introducing them to your main pond. Avoid overstocking your ponds. High stocking densities lead to stress and make fish more vulnerable to diseases. A well-balanced, high-quality diet will boost the fish's immune system, making them more resistant to parasites. Before stocking new fish, dry out the pond and apply lime at a rate of 10-15 kg per bigha (depending on the water's pH) to kill off any remaining parasites or their eggs.

Symptoms appear on leaves, nodes, panicles, and glumes. On leaves, small bluish-green flecks develop into characteristic spindle-shaped spots with grey centers and dark brown margins, known as leaf blast. These spots can merge under humid conditions, causing large portions of the leaf to dry and die, giving the field a burnt appearance. Nodal blast presents as black lesions girdling the nodes, leading to stem breakage and death of the upper plant parts. Internodal infection can cause white, empty panicles, mimicking yellow stem borer or drought damage. Neck blast causes grayish-brown lesions around the neck of the panicle, often leading to breakage or poor grain development, especially if infection occurs before the milky stage. Lesions can also form on panicle branches and spikelets. Effective management includes using resistant varieties, seed treatment with Carbendazim or Tricyclazole at 2–3 g/kg seed, and adopting good agronomic practices such as proper spacing, avoiding excess nitrogen, good drainage, and removing infected crop residues. At the first appearance of symptoms, apply fungicides such as Tricyclazole 75% WP at 120 g/acre, Isoprothiolane 40% EC at 300 ml/acre, or Azoxystrobin 23% SC at 200 ml/acre, diluted in 200 liters of water per acre.

Hand weeding is a very effective method, especially for small-scale farming. It is recommended to perform weeding at least twice, typically around 20 and 45 days after transplanting. Pre-Emergence Herbicides: These are applied right after transplanting before weeds emerge. They prevent the first flush of weed growth. Pretilachlor is a widely used pre-emergence herbicide that is effective against grasses, sedges, and broadleaf weeds. The recommended dosage is typically 600-750 ml per acre. Post-Emergence Herbicides: These are applied after weeds have emerged and are at the 2-5 leaf stage. They are often weed-specific. Bispyribac Sodium (10% SC) is a very effective, broad-spectrum herbicide that controls grasses, sedges, and broadleaf weeds. It's often used at a low dosage of 80-120 ml per acre and is safe for the rice crop.","https://icar-nrri.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/AAS_July_2022_II_English.pdf

Maintain consistent irrigation and avoid waterlogging.",TRUE,-,,"Yellowness in wheat can be caused by several factors, such as nutrient deficiencies (especially nitrogen and sulfur), yellow rust disease, waterlogging, or environmental stresses. If you notice yellow to orange pustules arranged in stripes along the leaf veins, and a yellow powder sticks to your finger when you rub the leaves, it may be due to yellow rust (stripe rust) disease. To control this, plant resistant varieties such as MP 4010, NW-1014 (PBW 550), and DBW 187. As soon as the first symptoms appear, spray fungicides like Propiconazole 25 EC @ 200 ml per acre or Tebuconazole 250 EC @ 200 ml per acre in 200 litres of water at 15-day intervals. If older, lower leaves turn yellow first, starting from the leaf tip and progressing inward, it may be due to nitrogen deficiency. To control this, apply 50 kg urea per acre as top dressing, or a 1% urea foliar spray (10 g urea per litre of water) immediately. If patches of yellow or white stripes appear between the veins of the leaves and growth is stunted, it may be due to zinc deficiency. To fix this, apply a foliar spray of zinc sulphate 0.5% solution (5 g zinc sulphate + 2.5 g unslaked lime per litre of water). If yellowness appears on younger, upper leaves, it may be due to sulphur deficiency. To control this, apply gypsum before sowing based on soil test recommendations. For a quick fix, use a 1% foliar spray of magnesium sulphate solution (10 g magnesium sulphate + 5 g unslaked lime per litre of water).

In a young crop, you can cover plants with straw or dry grass to shield them. For varieties, prefer Lok-1, GW-322, HI-1544 Purna, HD-2967, and Sujata, which are hardy and tolerate low temperatures better. Along with cultural practices, chemical sprays also help: a foliar spray of 8 to 10 kg of Urea or 8 to 10 kg of DAP dissolved in 400 to 500 liters of water per acre to make a 2% solution for foliar spray and spray once or twice at critical stages like tillering and booting to help plants recover from stress such as frost or pest damage. At the time of frost helps plants recover quickly. For stronger protection, use spray 0.1% Sulphuric Acid 400 ml in 400 liters of water or alternatives like Hexaconazole 200 ml/acre, Penconazole 100 ml/acre, mixed in 200-250 liters of water. Spray at first frost signs and repeat in 10–15 days if cold continues. For long-term safety, treat seeds before sowing with Thiram + Carbendazim @ 3 g/kg seed, and always test soil at KVK or District Agriculture Office so the crop gets balanced nutrition that increases tolerance to stress.

A common issue faced is the yellowing of wheat crops, a symptom of stress rather than a single disease. Accurately identifying the cause is essential for effective treatment. Carefully observe the pattern of yellowing in the field. If the leaves show distinct yellow stripes parallel to the veins and release a yellow-orange powder when touched, the crop is likely suffering from Yellow Rust (Pili Kungi). This is a fungal disease that requires immediate attention. If the yellowing is uniform across the leaves without any stripes, it is likely a nutrient deficiency. If the yellowing starts on the lower, older leaves and moves upwards, it indicates a Nitrogen Deficiency. Conversely, if it appears on the upper, newer leaves, it points to a Sulphur Deficiency. Yellowing can also appear in scattered patches throughout the field. This could be due to Zinc Deficiency, characterized by yellowing between the veins of the middle leaves, or it could be a sign of waterlogging in low-lying areas after heavy rain. Once the cause is identified, the correct treatment can be applied. For Yellow Rust, an immediate fungicide spray is critical. A recommended dosage is 200 ml of Propiconazole 25% EC or Tebuconazole 250 EC mixed in 200 liters of water per acre. The best long-term prevention is to sow rust-resistant varieties of wheat. Nitrogen Deficiency is corrected by applying Urea as a top dressing. As per PAU recommendations, farmers should apply 55 kg of Urea per acre with the first irrigation and another 55 kg with the second irrigation. For Sulphur Deficiency, using Single Super Phosphate (SSP) at the time of sowing is the best preventive method. If the deficiency is observed later, a foliar spray of 1 kg of Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate (21%) mixed in 200 liters of water can help. Zinc Deficiency requires a specific spray solution: 1 kg of Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate (21%) and 500 grams of unslaked lime mixed in 200 liters of water per acre.

Missing irrigation at these times can significantly reduce yield. The most important stages are:Crown Root Initiation (CRI): Occurs approximately 20–25 days after sowing (DAS). Water stress during this stage severely affects root development and overall plant growth. Tillering Stage: Around 40–45 DAS. Proper irrigation promotes the growth of new shoots (tillers), leading to more productive spikes. Jointing Stage: At 60–65 DAS, the stem begins to elongate. Adequate water ensures proper stem development and nutrient uptake. Flowering Stage: Around 85–90 DAS, this is a critical period for grain setting. Water stress during flowering can reduce pollination and grain formation. Milk Stage: Approximately 100–105 DAS. Irrigation ensures proper grain size and weight as the grains fill with a milky substance. Dough Stage: Around 115–120 DAS. The final irrigation ensures that grains fully develop and mature properly.",https://iiwbr.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Technology-for-Increasing-Wheat-Production-in-India-1989-90.pdf https://iiwbr.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Advisory-to-wheat-farmers-January-1-15-2025.pdf https://dwd.da.gov.in/DWD_UploadDocuments/ProductTechnology_22062020_Practices.pdf

Dange,"Leaf yellowing in wheat is a common issue in the Madhya Pradesh region and can be caused by several factors. The two primary causes are nutrient deficiencies and fungal diseases. If the yellowing begins on the older, lower leaves and moves upward, it is likely a nitrogen deficiency. For this,a top dressing of urea is recommended. The application dose is 20 to 25 kilograms of urea/acre. Apply the urea and then provide light irrigation to help it incorporate into the soil. A single application is usually sufficient if the problem is addressed early. If the yellowing appears between the veins on the middle leaves, it may indicate a zinc deficiency. For this,a foliar spray is the most effective solution. Use zinc sulphate heptahydrate at a rate of 1.0 to 1.5 kilograms/acre. Dissolve the zinc in 200 liters of water for spraying. Apply two sprays,with the second application coming 15 to 20 days after the first. If the yellowing appears as stripes of powdery pustules or irregular spots, a fungal disease like yellow rust is the cause. For curative control,a fungicide like tebuconazole and trifloxystrobin combination is effective. The application dose is 150 to 200 ml/acre,mixed in 200 liters of water. A single spray is often enough,but a follow-up application after 15 days may be needed for severe cases. For a protective spray against fungal diseases, mancozeb can be used.

Selection of Rust tolerant varieties such as WH 147; GW 190; H 1977GW273; GW322;; DL 803-3; Lok 1 is needed.  Avoid excess nitrogen application, which makes plants more susceptible. Practice crop rotation with non-host crops to break the disease cycle. Remove and destroy volunteer wheat plants (“self-sown” or ratoon wheat) that harbor rust pathogens.

During the vegetative stage yellow stem borer causes dead hearts symptom where the central shoot dries and dies. In the reproductive stage, it produces whiteheads which are empty whitish panicles without grains, and creamy-white, oval egg masses, covered in brownish hairs, can be found near the tips of the leaves. For sustainable and effective control, an Integrated Pest Management(IPM) approach combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and chemical measures are recommended. Plant your paddy crop within a similar timeframe as your neighbours to break the pest's life cycle and prevents its spread from one field to another. Clip the tips of seedlings before transplanting to eliminate eggs, and apply recommended nitrogen fertilizer in split dose. Plough the field after harvest to destroy the larvae hiding in stubble, then flood the field with water, this will kill the stem borer and reduce its attack in the next crop. Select rice varieties with short stature and shorter growth duration periods which suffer less damage than long growth duration varieties. Encourage spiders, damselflies, and Bracon wasps which are natural predators of the stem borer and release egg parasitoid Trichogramma japonicum thrice at weekly intervals, starting from 28 days after transplanting @ 40000 per acre/release. Insecticide spray is recommended if the stem borer population cross threshold level. At the vegetative stage, the economic threshold is 2 egg masses per square meter or 10% dead hearts symptom, while at the flowering stage it is 2% whiteheads symptom.

Or for every 10–12 kg of seed, use 200–250 g of Rhizobium culture and 200–250 g of PSB culture. Sprinkle the cultures over the seeds with the jaggery solution and mix gently until uniformly coated. Spread the treated seed in a thin layer in the shade and dry for about 30 minutes; do not dry in direct sunlight. Sow the treated seed on the same day to preserve the viability of Rhizobium and PSB. If you use Trichoderma viride or Pseudomonas fluorescens for seed treatment, do not apply chemical fungicide to the same seed lot. Seed treatment in wheat is necessary to protect the seed from seed- or soil-borne diseases and early-season pests. Treat seed before sowing with Carboxin 75 WP at 2.5-3 grams per kg seed, Carbendazim 50 WP at 2.5-3 grams per kg seed, or Carboxin 37.5% + Thiram 37.5% DS at 2.5-3 grams per kg seed to protect against major fungal disease. Additionally, treat seeds with Tebuconazole 2% DS at 1.15 grams per kg of seed to protect against loose smut/Kandwa disease. In termite-infected soil, treat the seed with Chlorpyrifos 20 EC at 4 ml per kg of seed or Thiamethoxam 70 FS at 1 gram per kg of seed before sowing. After chemical treatment, when the seed is dried, you can treat the seeds with PSB (Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria) culture, which significantly increases the availability of phosphorus to the plant. The recommended dose is typically 5 to 10 grams of PSB culture per kilogram of seed.",https://www.kvknagpur.org.in/WeeklyAdvisory/31102024fornagpurdistricts/RAMTEK_31102024E.pdf https://agritech.tnau.ac.in/seed_certification/seed_treatment_Insecticides%20%26%20Fungicides.html https://iiwbr.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EB-52-Wheat-Cultivation-in-India-Pocket-Guide.pdf

An integrated approach using cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods is most effective for the MP region. The choice of herbicide depends on the predominant type of weeds in your field, whether they are broadleaf weeds or grassy weeds. For broad-spectrum control, a pre-emergence application is often recommended. Apply Pendimethalin 30%EC at a dose of 800-1000 ml/acre. This herbicide should be applied immediately after sowing but before the germination of the wheat crop. It must be mixed in 120-150 liters of water/acre for uniform spraying.

For guja weevil and similar pests, do soil solarization by covering wet soil with polythene for 15 days before sowing, plant pea or marigold as a trap crop, conserve birds and spiders, and if needed, use approved chemicals like Thiamethoxam at 3.3 ml per acre of seed for seed treatment and Fipronil 5 SC: Apply 500 ml per acre mixed in 150–200 liters of water as a soil treatment at sowing, or as an alternative, you may use Imidacloprid 17.8 SL: use 40-50 ml per acre in 150–200 liters of water for soil drenching or 0.35 litre or 350 ml dosage per 100 kg of seeds as a seed treatment slurry. Along with this, always practice crop rotation with non-cereal crops every 2–3 years, keep the field neat, and follow recommended doses only. Along with these steps, also maintain PHI for safety. Keep 30 days for Thiamethoxam 30% FS, keep 60 days for Chlorpyrifos 20% EC, Carbofuran 3% CG, and Fipronil 5 SC, and keep 40 days for Imidacloprid 17.8 SL. By following these steps, you can save your crop from root pest attacks.",https://iiwbr.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WHEAT-CROP-HEALTH-NEWSLETTER-FEB.-2025.pdf https://iiwbr.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EB-52-Wheat-Cultivation-in-India-Pocket-Guide.pdf https://iiwbr.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DWR-Perspective-Plan-Vision-2025.pdf

In Madhya Pradesh, the process for farmers to register for MSP procurement is primarily managed through the state's e-Uparjan portal. This online system is designed to streamline the process, from registration and slot booking to payment. Go to the official e-Uparjan portal of the Madhya Pradesh government. The URL is typically mpeuparjan.nic.in. Make sure you are on the correct and official government website. The registration process is time-bound and opens for a specific period before the start of the procurement season (e.g., for wheat, registration starts a few weeks before the Rabi harvest). The portal will have a clear announcement regarding the start and end dates. You need to have the following documents ready:Samagra ID: This is a crucial ID for all residents of Madhya Pradesh. Aadhaar Card: It must be linked to your mobile number and bank account. Bank Passbook: You need to provide your bank account number and IFSC code. The account must be linked with your Aadhaar for direct benefit transfer (DBT). Land Records: You will need your land details, such as the Khasra and Khatauni numbers (B1, B2, or loan book), to prove ownership and the area under cultivation. Mobile Number: A valid mobile number linked with your Aadhaar is mandatory for OTP-based verification. You can register yourself from the comfort of your home using your mobile phone or computer. The portal has a farmer registration link for the specific season. If you don't have internet access or face any difficulty with the online process, you can visit the nearest Common Service Center (CSC), MP Online Kiosk, Lok Seva Kendra, Cooperative Society, or Mandi. On the e-Uparjan homepage, find the link for ""Farmer Registration"" for the current season (e.g., ""Rabi 2024-25 Farmer Registration""). A form will appear where you'll enter your Samagra ID, Aadhaar number, and mobile number. You will receive an OTP on your Aadhaar-linked mobile number to verify your identity. Complete the form with your personal details, bank account information, and land records (village name, Khasra number, and the area you have cultivated for the specific crop). After filling out all the details, submit the form. You will receive a registration number or an application ID, which you should save or print for future reference.Once your registration is approved, you will need to book a specific date and time slot to sell your produce at a designated procurement center (mandi). This helps in managing the flow of farmers and ensures a smooth process. On your booked date, take your produce to the procurement center. The officials will check the quality and quantity, and if it meets the standards, the payment will be directly transferred to your Aadhaar-linked bank account."," www.mpeuparjan.nic.in  https://ebijuka.com/farmer-registration-for-wheat-gram-chana-procurement-on-msp-step-by-step-guide/?hl=en-IN#:~:text=The%20Minimum%20Support%20Price%20(MSP,stocks%20and%20stabilize%20market%20prices.  https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2112407&hl=en-IN#:~:text=Government%20procures%20cereals%20and%20coarse,price%20support%20to%20the%20farmers.  https://jaagrukbharat.com/understanding-mp-euparjan-kharif-202425-a-guide-for-farmers-1473947?hl=en-IN  https://digivill.in/govtscheme/mp-e-uparjan?hl=en-IN","Yes, wheat is a key crop included in the Minimum Support Price (MSP) scheme announced by the Government of India.

Seed & Varieties: Seed rate depends on the method: SRI – 2 kg/acre, Transplanting - 15-20 kg/acre, Pots – 10–12 kg/acre. Early maturing varieties (Danteshwari) yield 12-15 qt/acre, medium duration varieties (Pusa Sugandh 3 & 4, MTU-1010, IR-36) yield 20–22 qt/acre, and hybrids (JRH-5, JRH-8, PRH-10, Sahyadri, Arize series) yield 26–28 qt/acre. Choose varieties based on land type and irrigation availability.

Sowing & Transplanting: Best time is mid-June to the first week of July. Row sowing: 20 cm spacing; transplanting: 2–3 week-old seedlings, 2–3 per hill. Geometry: early – 15×15 cm, medium – 20×15 cm, late – 25×20 cm.

Seed Treatment & Bio-fertilizers: Treat seeds with Carbendazim or Carbendazim + Mancozeb (approx. 2–3 g/kg seed). Apply 5 kg Azospirillium/Azotobacter + PSB with 50 kg compost per acre. Twenty days after transplanting, apply 6 kg of blue-green algae per acre in 3 cm of water.

Nutrient Management: Apply 2–4 tons compost or cow dung/acre. For green manure, sow Sunai or Dhaincha at 10 kg/acre one month before transplanting. Fertilizers per acre: early – N 16–20 kg, P 8–12 kg, K 6–8 kg; medium – N 32–40 kg, P 12–16 kg, K 10–12 kg; hybrids – N 48 kg, P 24 kg, K 16 kg. Apply N in split doses as per growth stage. Use 10 kg zinc sulphate/acre at sowing or transplanting.

Weed Control: Use Pretilachlor 500 ml/acre (2–3 days after sowing), Bispyribac Sodium 30 ml/acre (15–20 days), and 2,4-D 400 ml/acre (25–35 days).

Disease Management: Treat seeds with Tricyclazole, Carbendazim, or Carbendazim + Mancozeb (2–3 g/kg). Spray fungicides if disease appears. For Khaira (zinc deficiency), apply 8–10 kg zinc sulphate/acre. Grain smut: Chlorothalonil 0.8 g/kg seed and spray 0.8 g/litre water on infected ears.

Pest Management: Leaf roller, Stem Borer-Chlorantraniliprole 60 ml/acre water; Brown planthopper/stink bug – Acetamiprid 50 g/acre. Spray when infestation appears.

Harvesting & Storage: Harvest when fully ripe to avoid grain loss. Dry in field 1–2 days, then thresh, winnow, and sun-dry grains before storage.","https://www.jnkvv.org/

To ensure robust and high-yielding wheat, several management practices are recommended. Apply fertilizers based on soil test results. Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) are particularly important for wheat growth. Deficiencies in micronutrients like Sulfur (S), Iron (Fe), and Zinc (Zn) can also hamper growth. In some cases, yellowing can be a sign of sulfur deficiency, which is often confused with nitrogen deficiency.

Over-irrigation can lead to waterlogging and yellowing of the crop. Yellowness (chlorosis) in wheat can be caused by various factors, from nutrient deficiencies to diseases and pests. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency: This is the most common cause of yellowing. The symptoms typically appear first on the oldest (lower) leaves, as nitrogen is a mobile nutrient and the plant moves it to newer growth. Apply supplemental nitrogen fertilizer, such as urea or urea ammonium nitrate solution, as a top dressing. Sulfur (S) Deficiency: This can look similar to nitrogen deficiency, but it appears on the younger (upper) leaves first, as sulfur is an immobile nutrient. Apply a sulfur-containing fertilizer like gypsum, or a fertilizer like ammonium sulfate, which contains both nitrogen and sulfur. Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust): This is a fungal disease that can be devastating for wheat. It causes bright yellow, elongated stripes of spores on the leaves. When touched, the spores can be seen on the hands. As soon as symptoms appear, spray a fungicide such as Propiconazole 25% EC @ 200ml per acre or Mancozeb 75% WP @ 600-800 g per acre.

Apply nitrogen and potash in split doses, avoid excess nitrogen as it increases pest attack. In nursery, clip the tips of seedlings before transplanting to reduce pest carryover, remove and burn infested plants, and if possible, use coir rope to drag over crop and drop insects into kerosinized water (0.40 litre kerosene mixed with 10.1 kg soil per acre) ). Also drain the crop for 5–7 days during sensitive stage to reduce larvae. For biological help, protect natural enemies like parasitoid wasp (Platygaster oryzae), predatory mites, spiders and release Trichogramma japonicum or T. chilonis @ 40,500 parasitized eggs per acre at egg stage, about 10 days after transplanting.

The subsidy rate is set at fifty percent of the machine's cost. This financial support is subject to a ceiling limit of one point two five lakh rupees for a standard four-row paddy transplanter. The subsidy scheme is available to individual farmers, Custom Hiring Centers, and Farmer Producer Organizations. The price of a paddy transplanter varies considerably based on its type and features. A basic manual walk-behind model typically ranges from one point five to two point five lakh rupees. A more advanced four-row riding type transplanter can cost between three point 500000 to 650000 rupees. After applying the maximum subsidy, the effective out-of-pocket cost for a four-row machine would be approximately two point seven five lakh rupees for a model priced at four lakh rupees. The area a transplanter can cover depends on its type. A manual walk-behind transplanter operated by a single person can cover approximately zero point three to zero point four acres in a full day. A four-row riding type machine is significantly more efficient, capable of transplanting two to three acres per day during an eight to ten hour operating period.

A lack of moisture during this time can severely impact the final yield. Water is essential for the proper development and filling of the grains. Inadequate water can lead to shrunken, shriveled, and lighter grains, significantly reducing the final yield and market value. Proper soil moisture ensures that the plant can efficiently absorb and transport nutrients from the soil to the developing grains. The milking stage typically occurs 100-105 days after sowing (DAS). It is often the fifth irrigation in a standard irrigation schedule for wheat in the region. The exact timing can vary slightly depending on the wheat variety, soil type, and prevailing weather conditions. The amount of water required for irrigation at the milking stage and for the entire crop duration can vary. A typical irrigation depth is 6-8 cm. The actual amount to be applied depends on soil moisture levels. A good practice is to irrigate when the soil appears dry and the plant shows signs of stress.",TRUE,-,,"Irrigating wheat during the milking stage is a crucial practice for maximizing yield and grain quality.

Wheat becomes very dry and easy to catch fire when fully ripe. Main causes of fire are cigarette sparks, electric sparks from damaged transformers or wires, hot parts or silencer sparks from tractors, combines, or threshers, burning wheat straw or crop residue, and careless handling of fire near fields. To prevent fire, never allow smoking near the wheat field, especially during harvesting and drying time. Always keep electric poles and transformers in good condition and avoid working near them in very dry weather. Make sure machines are well maintained—keep the silencer mouth facing upward, check for oil leaks, and do not overheat engines while working. Do not burn wheat straw; instead, use it as fodder or for mulching the field to improve soil health. Make small firebreaks (empty strip of land) around the field and always keep watch during harvest time when the weather is dry and windy. Keep a few buckets of water, soil, or a small fire extinguisher nearby to quickly stop any small fire before it spreads. If fire happens, first turn off all engines and machines close to the fire so it does not get bigger, move tractors or tools away from fire, and call local fire services if the fire cannot be controlled.

Apply when leaf folding is first observed, with a second application if needed after 12-15 days. Always follow manufacturer instructions and avoid using banned chemicals like monocrotophos.","https://icar-nrri.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AAS_October_2024_II_English.pdf

Sucking pests, such as brown planthoppers, green leafhoppers, and thrips, can cause significant damage by feeding on plant sap, leading to stunted growth, yellowing, and even ""hopper burn"" (scorched appearance). They can also transmit diseases like rice tungro virus. To control them, an integrated pest management approach combining cultural, mechanical, biological, and chemical measures is recommended. Avoid excessive use of nitrogen fertilizer. Keep the field and surrounding bunds clean by removing weeds and volunteer plants. Plant rice all at once in a region within a short window (up to 3 weeks) to break pest life cycles and reduce buildup. Avoid close planting to allow for better air circulation, which can reduce pest pressure. For upland rice, practicing intercropping with plants like soybean can help reduce the incidence of leafhoppers. Drain fields for 3-4 days during early pest attack, disrupting breeding of planthoppers. Conserve and encourage natural enemies like lacewings, ladybird beetles, predatory wasps, and spiders, and apply foliar spray of neem oil(2-5%) or 5% neem seed kernel extract.

This beneficial fungus competes with the leaf rot pathogen and reduces its survival in soil, giving long-term protection. Repeat once mid-season if field history shows high disease pressure. After harvest, remove and burn badly infected clumps so the fungus doesn’t survive in the next crop. By using these combining steps, you can control rot disease in paddy.",TRUE,-,,"Paddy shows several diseases, like leaf rot, which is commonly known as sheath rot, a serious problem in paddy crops. Sheath rot is caused by the fungus Sarocladium oryzae and generally affects rice from late tillering to maturity, especially in fields with standing water and excessive nitrogen use. Symptoms include grey to brown lesions on the upper leaf sheath (that encloses the flowering panicle), white powdery fungal growth inside the sheath, incomplete panicle emergence, and shrivelled or sterile grains. Affected sheaths may rot, and panicles often fail to fully emerge, resulting in poor grain filling and yield losses. To stop it, first you can follow crop rotation with wheat or maize, don’t overuse urea, and keep proper water management—if you see infection, drain water for 4–5 days. Use recommended tolerant varieties like NDR 359, Jaya, MTU 7029, Swarna Sub-1, and Sahbhagi Dhan for better safety. For chemical control, you can foliar spray Validamycin 3% L @ 400 ml per acre or Propiconazole 25% EC @ 200 ml in 200 litres of water per acre with a knapsack or power sprayer. As an alternative, you can use Hexaconazole 5% EC @ 400 ml/acre—it also works well and is safe for paddy. Start the spray whenever you can see the first symptom. Make sure you cover the base of the tillers where the rot starts, keep a 10–12 day gap between sprays if a repeat is needed, and you should maintain a pre-harvest interval (PHI) of at least 14 days for Validamycin 3% L, 15 days for Propiconazole 25% EC, and 14–15 days for Hexaconazole 5% EC to ensure no chemical residue remains in the grains or straw before harvest.

These insecticides should be applied according to label instructions, preferably during early morning or late evening, to minimize harm to beneficial insects and maximize effectiveness. Monitoring adult moth populations with light traps and pheromone traps helps in timely interventions. Following these combined strategies ensures effective control of stem borer in paddy crops.","https://plantwiseplusknowledgebank.org/doi/full/10.1079/pwkb.20157800028

These critical stages include the tillering stage (40-45 days after sowing), the late jointing stage, flag leaf emergence, booting, flowering, and the milk/dough stage of grain development. The number of irrigations can vary from 4 to 6, depending on soil type, with light soils requiring more frequent applications than heavier clay soils. It is important to avoid waterlogging and to ensure that irrigation is stopped well before harvest to allow for proper field drying. The use of water-efficient methods like sprinklers or drip irrigation is highly encouraged to conserve water.",https://iiwbr.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EB-52-Wheat-Cultivation-in-India-Pocket-Guide.pdf https://agritech.tnau.ac.in/agriculture/agri_irrigationmgt_wheat.html https://www.fao.org/3/y3655e/y3655e09.htm

The disease appears at the flowering stage, replacing grains with black powdery spores. Since the fungus grows internally within the seed, prevention through seed treatment is crucial. Several wheat varieties show resistance to loose smut in Punjab conditions, like HD 2967, which demonstrates moderate resistance against the disease. PBW 725 offers good resistance to both loose smut and rust diseases. WH 1105 shows tolerance to smut and other foliar diseases. PBW 550, recommended for Punjab, provides moderate resistance.

Termites can damage the sown seeds, leading to poor germination and a reduced plant stand. Termites feed on the roots and lower parts of the stems of young plants. Affected plants show signs of wilting and yellowing. In mature plants, the most characteristic symptom is the appearance of dry, white earheads that contain no grains. This is caused by termites feeding on the base of the stalk, cutting off the nutrient supply to the ear. The white ears can be easily pulled out of the ground. A combination of preventive and chemical measures is the most effective way to manage termites in wheat such as Ploughing the field deeply during the summer months exposes termite colonies and queens to the sun and predatory birds, killing them and reducing the initial population. Ensure that you use well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM). The use of fresh or improperly decomposed manure can attract termites. Termites prefer dry soil. Keeping the field adequately moist during the early stages can help in reducing termite activity. Give a seed treatment of Imidacloprid 70% WS @ 3-5 grams per kg of seeds for seed treatment or Thiamethoxam 70% WS @ 2-3 grams per kg seed treatment. Mix the required amount of powder with a small amount of water to make a slurry. Coat the wheat seeds evenly with this slurry before sowing. This protects for the initial 30-45 days. Alternatively, you can use Fipronil 0.3% GR at 5-10 kg per acre (for broadcast application), or Metarhizium anisopliae at 2-4 kg per acre in a powder formulation or 1-2 litres per acre in a liquid formulation.

It's the remaining part of the plant, mainly rice stalks and roots, after the grain is harvested. This term is frequently used in Hindi and Punjabi, and is associated with the practice of stubble burning, which is a major contributor to air pollution in some regions. After harvesting rice, farmers are left with the leftover stalks and roots, which are called parali.

Available in liquid and granulated forms (e.g., Sagarika Liquid, Sagarika Gold, and Sagarika Z++). Benefits are enhanced nutrient use efficiency. Sagarika is a biostimulant that enhances nutrient efficiency; it is a supplement to, not a replacement for, the standard recommended NPK fertilizer dose. Boosts soil microbial activity and improves soil health, strengthens root and shoot growth, enhances tillering, and improves overall plant vigor. Enhances crop resilience to abiotic stresses like drought, heat, and salinity. Leads to higher yields and better crop quality—farmers have reported significantly improved paddy crop health and market performance after using Sagarika. Sagarika Z++ Granules: Contains seaweed extract plus bio-potash (8–10%), micronutrients like zinc and boron, amino acids, plant hormones (auxin, cytokinin, gibberellins), betaines, mannitol, etc. Used as a soil or basal application: typically, 10 kg per acre at sowing/transplanting and again at 15–20 days after sowing. Sagarika Liquid (Seaweed Extract Concentrate, 28% w/w): Applied as a foliar spray: usually 500 ml per acre (approx. 5 ml per liter of water) at specific crop stages.","https://sagarika.com/

Growth stage - The ear (panicle) initiation stage starts about 55–60 days after transplanting (in early maturing varieties) and a little later in long-duration varieties. The growing point (meristem) changes from vegetative (leaf producing) to reproductive (panicle producing). At this stage, the developing panicle is about 1–2 mm in size and hidden inside the stem (boot leaf). This is the most critical stage for yield formation. The number of spikelets (potential grains) per panicle is determined at this stage. Moisture stress, nutrient deficiency, or pest attack during this time can drastically reduce yield.

Use plastic trays (2–3 inch deep) or earthen pots with small holes at the bottom for drainage. Fill with a mixture of 50% garden soil + 50% well-rotted compost/vermicompost. Level the surface. Spread sprouted seeds evenly on the tray/bed surface. Cover lightly with a thin layer of soil or compost. Keep in shade for 1–2 days until seedlings emerge. Sprinkle water daily (do not overwater). Keep trays in semi-shade or indirect sunlight. Avoid strong direct afternoon sun (especially in the summer). No chemical fertilizer/pesticide needed (kept organic). Wheatgrass will be ready in 7–10 days when the height reaches 6–8 inches. Cut just above the root level with clean scissors. One tray can give 2–3 harvests if maintained properly. Making wheatgrass juice - Wash harvested wheatgrass thoroughly. Use a slow juicer/wheatgrass juicer (not a normal mixer, as it may heat the juice). Grind/crush the wheatgrass with a little water and strain through a fine muslin cloth or strainer. Consume immediately (oxidises fast), benefits 30–50 ml of fresh juice daily on an empty stomach, rich in chlorophyll, iron, vitamins A, C, E, B-complex, calcium, magnesium. Known to boost immunity, detoxify blood, improve digestion, and increase haemoglobin. Wheatgrass can be grown around the year in trays (indoor/greenhouse). For commercial purposes: Polyhouse/Net house cultivation + marketing in urban centres (Ludhiana, Chandigarh, Jalandhar) as fresh juice shops, ready-cut grass packs, or juice bottles.",https://pau.edu/content/ccil/pf/pp_rabi.pdf https://iiwbr.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EB-52-Wheat-Cultivation-in-India-Pocket-Guide.pdf https://repository.cimmyt.org/bitstreams/0a04fd01-9a29-4067-b7f6-7b80829576c9/download

This also makes your crop more susceptible to diseases and pests because when we apply excess nitrogen fertilizer to crops, the plants grow very fast and produce soft, lush, and tender leaves. These tender leaves contain more sap, amino acids, and sugars, which act like “ready food” for many sucking pests such as aphids, whiteflies, jassids, and leafhoppers, as well as for caterpillars.

A key benefit is its role in the circular economy: paddy straw—a major source of air pollution from stubble burning—is used to produce biogas, and its waste is then returned to the fields as a valuable, eco-friendly fertilizer for the next wheat crop.",https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fsufs.2023.1234472/full https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8197978/ https://epubs.icar.org.in/index.php/JISSS/article/view/166021

The first irrigation should always be relatively light, it is advised to advance it slightly on light soils and delay it by a week on heavy soils. After December 5 sowing, irrigation should be continued up to April 10. During cloudy days, irrigation must be avoided to prevent lodging of the crop. Towards the end of January and February, the irrigation interval should be shortened, and in the absence of rainfall, timely-sown wheat should be irrigated at the end of March to avoid grain shriveling.","https://iiwbr.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EB-52-Wheat-Cultivation-in-India-Pocket-Guide.pdf
https://www.pau.edu/content/ccil/pf/pp_rabi.pdf","The time to avoid irrigation depends mainly on the crop, soil type, growth stage, and weather, but in general, it is advisable not to irrigate just before or after certain critical events like immediately after fertilizer or pesticide application (unless it’s meant to be incorporated). it is required to wait at least 24 hours to prevent nutrient loss or chemical wash-off.  For Urea, irrigation must be applied immediately after broadcasting to dissolve the granules and prevent significant nitrogen loss to the atmosphere.

 Irrigation decisions must always be crop-specific. In paddy, irrigation should be avoided at the time of grain ripening, since excess water at maturity delays harvest and lowers grain quality. 
In onion, over-irrigation during the maturity and bulb-drying stage should be avoided, as it reduces storability and causes rotting.
 For mustard, irrigation must not be given at the flowering and pod-maturity stage, because excess moisture encourages diseases and shattering. In most vegetables, especially cucurbits and solanaceous crops, irrigation should be avoided during flowering and immediately before harvest, as water stress or excess moisture at these stages can either reduce fruit set or affect keeping quality. 

Before harvest of crops like paddy, groundnut, onion, or sugarcane  the usual practice is to stop irrigation for 7–15 days before harvest to allow proper drying and improve quality.


After heavy rain it is better to wait until the topsoil is dry enough to prevent root diseases and compaction; this can take 3–5 days depending on soil type.

 For onions but is harmful to the quality of many leafy vegetables.",TRUE,-,,"For wheat sown up to November 21, the first irrigation should be given about three weeks after sowing, followed by the second and third irrigations at intervals of 5–6 weeks each, and the fourth irrigation after 4 weeks. 

For wheat sown between November 22 and December 20, the first irrigation is due three weeks after sowing, the second after 5–6 weeks, the third after 3–4 weeks, and the fourth after 2 weeks. 

For wheat sown between December 21 and January 15, the first irrigation is applied three weeks after sowing, the second after 4 weeks, the third after 3 weeks, and the fourth after 2 weeks. 

The first irrigation should always be relatively light, it is advised to advance it slightly on light soils and delay it by a week on heavy soils. After December 5 sowing, irrigation should be continued up to April 10. During cloudy days, irrigation must be avoided to prevent lodging of the crop. Towards the end of January and February, the irrigation interval should be shortened, and in the absence of rainfall, timely-sown wheat should be irrigated at the end of March to avoid grain shriveling.",,,FALSE,"The information you provided is indirect and does not correctly answer your question. Your question is about when to avoid irrigation, but the text you supplied is almost entirely about when to give irrigation. The irrigation schedules listed, which are based on fixed calendar intervals, are not the standard, scientifically recommended method. The official Package of Practices (POP) advises irrigating based on the critical growth stages of the crop. ",,"The critical stages of irrigation in wheat are those where water stress can cause maximum yield loss. 

The most important is the Crown Root Initiation (CRI) stage at 20–25 days after sowing, which is essential for root development and tillering. The second critical stage is tillering (40–45 DAS), when side shoots develop and determine the number of productive tillers. 

The jointing stage (stem elongation) also requires adequate moisture for healthy crop growth.

 Irrigation at the flowering stage ensures proper pollination and grain set, while at the grain-filling or milk/dough stage, it supports kernel development and prevents shriveled grains. 

However, irrigation should be avoided immediately after sowing to prevent seed rotting, and also just before crop maturity, as excess moisture at this stage can reduce grain quality and delay harvesting. During cloudy days, irrigation must be avoided to prevent lodging of the crop.

On average, wheat needs 4–6 irrigations depending on soil type and climate, but CRI, tillering, flowering, and grain filling are considered the most critical for achieving high yield.",FALSE,"Fails to answer the question: The question asks for a specific time to avoid the next watering, but the answer provides a list of critical stages when watering is nedded.
