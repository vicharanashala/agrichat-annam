It makes small holes in the fruits and damages young shoots, which leads to lower yields and reduced market prices. To get a good crop and income, you need to manage this pest carefully from the beginning. Start by keeping your field clean. Regularly pick and destroy damaged fruits and shoots to break the pest cycle. Avoid growing brinjal on the same land every season; instead, rotate with crops like maize, pulses, or wheat. Make sure there is enough space in the field, about 60 cm between rows and 45 cm between plants, so air and sunlight can reach the plants. For natural control, release Trichogramma egg parasitoids at 50,000 per acre every 15 days. These tiny wasps destroy fruit borer eggs. You can also spray Neem oil 1% at 1200 ml per acre or NSKE (Neem Seed Kernel Extract) 5% at 10 litres per acre. These options are safe and help reduce pests without harming helpful insects. If pest pressure is high, use safe and recommended chemicals. For example, you can use Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC at 66 ml per acre in 200–250 litres of water. This is effective and safe for beneficial insects. Alternatively, you can use Emamectin benzoate 5 SG at 100 g per acre or Spinosad 48 EC at 50 ml per acre in 200–250 litres of water. Remember, the waiting period before harvest (PHI) is 7–10 days. Always rotate these chemicals and do not use the same one repeatedly, or the pest may become resistant. Treat seeds with Trichoderma viride at 4 g per kg of seed to protect plants from soil fungus and make them stronger against borers. Get your soil tested at your local KVK or JNKVV lab so you can apply fertilizers correctly. Healthy plants can handle pests much better. If you follow all these steps together—keeping the field clean, rotating crops, using neem and Trichogramma for bio-control, and acting on time—fruit borer can be controlled well. Check your field regularly, spray on time, and never use too much chemicals. This way, your brinjal crop will stay healthy, fruits will be clean, and you will get a good yield.",https://niphm.gov.in/IPMPackages/Brinjal.pdf/ https://ppqs.gov.in/en/divisions/cib-rc/major-uses-of-pesticides,"Fruit borer in brinjal (Leucinodes orbonalis) in brinjal is a big headache for farmers, it makes small holes in fruits and also damages young shoots, due to which yield drops badly and market price also goes down.

Spray early morning or evening to save pollinators, and keep a 15-day gap, and for Imidacloprid 17.8% SL on pulses, it is 21 days before harvest after the last spray, but also follow the withdrawal period label as mentioned. Along with this, spray neem oil (2 ml per liter of water) or NSKE 5% to reduce whitefly safely and cut down on chemicals. Always do soil testing at KVK or a university lab and follow balanced fertilizer, because excess nitrogen makes crops weak and pest attacks heavy. If you keep your fields clean, rotate crops, use resistant varieties, treat seeds, add neem, and, if needed, spray approved chemicals in time, then yellow mosaic disease can be managed well, crops will stay healthy, and yields will be safe.",

To control them properly in Madhya Pradesh fields,  best to follow a mixed approach – cultural, biological, and chemical control method. First, keep the field clean and remove weeds around the crop because weeds give shelter to thrips, also avoid chilli after sorghum since thrips increase there. Intercropping with agathi (Sesbania) also helps. For natural protection, apply neem oil 1500 ppm @ 2 ml per litre water spray and use Katyayani Triple Attack bio agent @ 2 litres per acre, spraying with 200 to 250 litres of water per acre for good coverage. these reduce thrips without harming soil. For seed safety, treat seed with Trichoderma viride @ 4 g/kg seed or Imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 7.5 g/kg seed before sowing so plants start strong. Now for strong attack chemicals are needed but you should rotate to avoid resistance. Best and safer spray is Spinosad 45% SC @ 55–65 ml per acre in 200–250 litres water (maintain PHI 7days). If pressure is high, spray Imidacloprid 17.8% SL @ 40–50 ml per acre mixed in 200-250 litres water. For dual action and as an alternatively you can use very effective is Katyayani Nashak (Fipronil 40% + Imidacloprid 40% WG) @ 40–60 g per acre in 200–250 litres water, works both by contact and systemically and also controls whiteflies along with thrips. Another good option against resistant pests is Diafenthiuron 40.1% + Acetamiprid 3.9% WP @ 200–250 g per acre mixed in same volume of water. spray well on both sides of leaves. Always keep PHI gap of 7–10 days for (Imidacloprid 17.8% SL, Diafenthiuron 40.1% + Acetamiprid 3.9% WP,) in chillies before harvest (and 15–30 days for heavy products like Fipronil mixes (Fipronil 40% + Imidacloprid 40% WG ) if label says so).

First of all always use clean seed that is free from weed seeds, and do timely sowing so that wheat grows fast and suppresses the weeds. In summer do one or two deep ploughings so that the weed seeds and roots come up and die in sunlight, and you can also use the stale seedbed technique — wet the soil to germinate weeds and then kill them before sowing. Crop rotation and keeping the field clean are also very useful. In biological methods, mulching with residues keeps weeds suppressed, and wheat varieties with better ground cover also check weed growth. In chemical methods, you can use combined herbicide like Clodinafop-propargyl and  Metsulfuron-methyl (25 + 1.5 g per acre) and Sulfosulfuron and Metsulfuron-methyl (12 + 0.8 g per acre) which control both grassy and broadleaf weeds.

First thing, keep watering regular and even, neither too much nor too less, especially in flowering stage, and make sure field has good drainage, also protect plants from strong wind by barriers and do light pruning of extra branches so plant does not take stress, also keep orchard clean and remove weeds and if dioecious type then remove extra male plants after pollination.

Always test soil in the KVK or JNKVV lab to balance nutrients, especially boron, calcium, and zinc. For varieties, go with Red Lady, Pusa Dwarf, CO-7, Arka Prabhath, and Madhubindu, which have shown good fruit retention and yield in MP. Always remember to spray in the early morning or evening for better effect, follow the correct dose and water volume per acre, rotate chemicals if sprays are repeated, and maintain a harvest gap of 10–14 days after spraying. Other Tips: Intercrop with flowering plants (e.g., marigold, sunflower) in papaya rows and keep 1–2 honeybee boxes per acre for better fruit set. If you follow these steps, then your papaya will keep more flowers, set more fruits, and give you good profit with a healthy orchard.",TRUE,-,,"In papaya crops, flower dropping happens due to many reasons together, mainly due to water stress (either drought or waterlogging), nutrient imbalance (lack of nitrogen, boron, calcium, and potassium; then the plant cannot make strong flowers, especially boron and calcium deficiency directly breaks fruit setting), unfavorable weather (cold, heat 20–33°C with 70–85% humidity, strong winds), poor pollination, pests and diseases (thrips, aphids, mites, mildew, and ring spot), and wrong practices (poor drainage, excess fertilizer or pesticide, and too many male plants). First thing, keep watering regularly and evenly, neither too much nor too little, especially in the flowering stage, and make sure the field has good drainage. Also, protect plants from strong winds with barriers and do light pruning of extra branches so the plant does not take stress. Also, keep the orchard clean and remove weeds, and if it is the dioecious type, then remove extra male plants after pollination. For nutrition, foliar spray Boron 20% EDTA at 1 g per liter of water (200 liters per acre) at flowering and fruit set time, and if calcium or zinc deficiency is present, then give Zinc Sulphate 100 g per acre (0.5 g/liter) along with this mix. Add half the quantity of slaked lime to prevent leaf burn and mix with 200 liters of water per acre for full leaf coverage. For boron deficiency, you can use Borax Spray 200 g per acre (0.1 g/liter) with 200 liters of water per acre. Also use Azospirillum + Phosphobacteria. Apply 20 g per plant at planting and again at 6 months; for typical papaya density (900–1000 plants/acre), use 18–20 kg/acre of each. Mix well-rotted FYM/compost and broadcast in the root zone, or use as a soil drench with plenty of water. If pests like thrips, aphids, or mites attack, then spray Imidacloprid 17.8% SL 40-60 ml per acre (0.7–1 ml/liter) with 200 liters of water per acre. If a fungal disease like powdery mildew comes, then spray Mancozeb 75 WP 400 g per acre in 200 liters of water per acre for full coverage on leaves/stems.

For sucking pests like thrips, use an insecticide like Fipronil up to 1.5 to 2.0 ml/liter of water (300-400 ml/liter with 200-250 liters of water) with a 7-day interval. Maintain consistent soil moisture using drip irrigation and mulching. During extreme summer heat, consider using temporary shade nets. Finally, always consult your local Krishi Vigyan Kendra for advice specific to your field's conditions.",

The primary sucking pests in urd are aphids, jassids (leafhoppers), and whiteflies. You can start with prevention by selecting varieties that are resistant or tolerant to pests and diseases. Recommended resistant/tolerant varieties for cultivation in Madhya Pradesh include Pant Urd 31, Pant Urd 35, IPU 94-1, and Mash 414. Always use certified, disease-free seeds of these improved varieties. Prepare the field properly by removing all weed hosts and crop residues from previous seasons.Practice crop rotation with non-legume crops like cereals to break the pest life cycle. Ensure proper spacing between plants to avoid a crowded canopy that favors pest buildup. Monitor the crop regularly from the early vegetative stage for signs of pest activity. Look for yellowing leaves, hopper burn, sticky honeydew, or sooty mold. Use yellow sticky traps placed around the field to monitor and trap flying adult pests. If pests are detected below economic threshold levels, use botanical insecticides. A spray of neem oil at a rate of 3 to 5 ml/liter of water can be effective. For aphids and jassids, a spray of imidacloprid 17.8 SL is effective at 0.3 to 0.5 ml/liter of water (60 ml of imidacloprid in 200 liters of water).

To apply for a KCC, a farmer needs to approach their nearest bank branch with which they have an account. Required documents usually include proof of identity, proof of residence, land records, and passport-sized photographs. The application form is available at the bank branch and must be filled out with the necessary details. The bank then verifies the documents and the land records before sanctioning the limit. The credit limit is sanctioned for a period of up to five years, subject to an annual review. The card can be used at bank branches and ATMs to withdraw cash as per the sanctioned limit. For most banks, there is no processing fee or annual fee for the Kisan Credit Card. The scheme has been a cornerstone in ensuring credit flow to the agriculture sector in Madhya Pradesh. It has helped farmers avoid reliance on informal moneylenders who charge exorbitant interest rates. For the most accurate and detailed information, farmers should visit their local bank branch. They can also contact the District Lead Bank Manager or the Office of the District Agriculture Officer for guidance. The official website of the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) also provides detailed operational guidelines for the scheme.",

Cultural practices are essential for prevention and long-term control. Deep summer plowing helps to expose the soil to the sun and reduce the fungal inoculum. Practicing a crop rotation cycle of at least 2-3 years with non-host cereals like wheat or barley is vital to break the disease cycle. Ensuring good field drainage is also critical, as waterlogged conditions severely favor the disease. For chemical control, you can do seed treatment with 3 gm of Thiram 75% WP/kg of seeds. The seeds should be treated well before sowing. For soil application, which aims to disinfect the soil around the seed, Trichoderma viride is an effective bio-fungicide. The recommended application is to apply 4 to 5 grams of Trichoderma viride formulation/kg of seeds during seed treatment. For soil drenching, after the disease is spotted, a chemical fungicide like Thiram can be used. The dose for soil drenching is 2 gm of Thiram 50% WP per liter of water.

It is available to all types of farmers, including owner farmers, tenant farmers, Self Help Groups (SHGs), and Joint Liability Groups (JLGs). Farmers can use the loan amount for purchasing seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, machinery, dairy, poultry, fisheries, goatery, and even limited household needs. The loan limit is decided based on landholding, cropping pattern, and scale of finance fixed by the District Level Technical Committee (DLTC). Loan amounts start from around ₹10,000 to ₹50,000 for small and marginal farmers and go up to ₹3–5 lakhs or more, depending on requirements. The normal interest rate is 7% per annum, but farmers who repay on time may get a 3% interest subvention, so the effective interest rate becomes only 4%. The repayment period is one year for short-term crop loans and 3–5 years for term loans like tractors, pump sets, or dairy units. For loans up to ₹1.6 lakh, generally no collateral is required, while higher loans may need land documents as security. Farmers can apply for KCC in any nationalized bank, cooperative bank, or regional rural bank in Madhya Pradesh, such as SBI, PNB, Central Bank of India, MP Gramin Bank, or District Cooperative Bank, by filling out the KCC application form.

Heavy infestations can weaken the plant, leading to yellowing of leaves, stunted growth, wilting, and premature leaf drop. Whiteflies excrete a sticky, sugary substance called ""honeydew"" on the leaves. This honeydew promotes the growth of a black, sooty mold fungus. The most significant damage caused by whiteflies is their ability to transmit viral diseases, most notably the Tomato Leaf Curl Virus (ToLCV).

Weeds compete with the crop for water, nutrients, and sunlight, and if not managed properly, can cause yield losses of up to 80%. An integrated weed management approach, combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods, is the most effective strategy. The first 6 to 7 weeks after sowing is the most critical period for weed competition in soybean. It is essential to keep the field weed-free during this time to prevent significant yield loss. Ploughing the field during the summer months helps expose weed seeds and rhizomes to the sun, killing them and reducing the initial weed load.  Using traditional tools like a dora or kulpa (a bullock-drawn blade harrow) at 20-25 days after sowing (DAS) and a second time at 40-45 DAS is a highly effective method. This breaks up the soil crust, improves soil aeration, and uproots weeds. If labor is available, one or two rounds of hand weeding, especially within the rows, can be very effective. Hand weeding at 20 and 40 DAS is often recommended. Chemical Control (Herbicides): Pre-Emergence Herbicides, these are applied to the soil after sowing but before the weeds or crop emerge.

Apply a systemic fungicide like Tricyclazole (150-200 g/acre) or Carbendazim 50% WP (200 grams per acre). The most effective time to apply fungicides is during the late boot stage and at 50% heading to prevent neck blast, which causes the most yield loss. The PHI for tricyclazole in paddy is generally 40 days, and for carbendazim it is 15 to 20 days.","https://plantwiseplusknowledgebank.org/doi/full/10.1079/pwkb.20167800019

The yellowing spreads upwards to younger leaves as the deficiency becomes more severe. The plant's growth is stunted and tillering is poor. Apply urea (46% N) as a top dressing. A common recommendation is 30-40 kg of urea per acre. It's best to apply it in two split doses: one at the active tillering stage (20-25 days after sowing) and another at the panicle initiation stage (40-45 days after sowing). Sulfur deficiency: Yellowing of the younger, upper leaves first. The yellowing may spread to the entire plant. Apply gypsum (Calcium Sulfate) at a rate of 100-200 kg per hectare before sowing. Alternatively, apply ammonium sulfate (24% S) as a source of both nitrogen and sulfur. Yellowing can also be a symptom of a fungal disease, particularly yellow rust. The most characteristic symptom is the appearance of small, yellow-orange pustules arranged in stripes or streaks on the leaves. When you touch an infected leaf, a yellow powder (spores) will rub off on your fingers. Spray Propiconazole 25% EC @ 200 ml per acre or Tebuconazole 250 EC @  150 ml per acre.

It requires a cool climate for its vegetative growth and a warm temperature for maturity. In Madhya Pradesh, the sowing of lentils is done during the post-monsoon period, typically from October to November, and the harvesting takes place in the spring. As aphids feed by sucking the sap from the plant, the affected leaves may curl, crinkle, or become distorted. The continuous loss of sap can also cause the leaves to turn yellow and eventually drop off. A heavy aphid population can weaken the plant significantly, leading to stunted growth, reduced branching, and poor pod formation.

They can cause severe damage from the sowing stage up to maturity by feeding on the roots and base of the stem, leading to reduced plant stand and a condition known as ""white ears."" Termites can damage the sown seeds, leading to poor germination and a reduced plant stand. Termites feed on the roots and lower parts of the stems of young plants. Affected plants show signs of wilting and yellowing. In mature plants, the most characteristic symptom is the appearance of dry, white earheads that contain no grains. This is caused by termites feeding on the base of the stalk, cutting off the nutrient supply to the ear. The white ears can be easily pulled out of the ground. A combination of preventive and chemical measures is the most effective way to manage termites in wheat such as ploughing the field deeply during the summer months exposes termite colonies and queens to the sun and predatory birds, killing them and reducing the initial population.

Termites can damage the sown seeds, leading to poor germination and a reduced plant stand. Termites feed on the roots and lower parts of the stems of young plants. Affected plants show signs of wilting and yellowing. In mature plants, the most characteristic symptom is the appearance of dry, white earheads that contain no grains. This is caused by termites feeding on the base of the stalk, cutting off the nutrient supply to the ear. The white ears can be easily pulled out of the ground. A combination of preventive and chemical measures is the most effective way to manage termites in wheat such as ploughing the field deeply during the summer months exposes termite colonies and queens to the sun and predatory birds, killing them and reducing the initial population. Ensure that you use well-decomposed Farm Yard Manure (FYM). The use of fresh or improperly decomposed manure can attract termites. Termites prefer dry soil. Keeping the field adequately moist during the early stages can help in reducing termite activity. Give a seed treatment of Imidacloprid 70% WS @ 3-5 grams per kg of seed treatment or Thiamethoxam 25% WG @ 2-3 grams per kg of seed treatment. Mix the required amount of powder with a small amount of water to make a slurry. Coat the wheat seeds evenly with this slurry before sowing. This protects for the initial 30-45 days. Or you can use Fipronil 0.3% GR @ 5-10 kg per acre (for broadcast application), Metarhizium anisopliae @ 2-4 kg per acre of a powder formulation or 1-2 liters per acre of a liquid formulation. This is a bio-pesticide that is highly effective against termites. It is a fungus that infects and kills the termites upon contact.

Symptoms appear on leaves, nodes, panicles, and glumes. On leaves, small bluish-green flecks develop into characteristic spindle-shaped spots with grey centers and dark brown margins, known as leaf blast. These spots can merge under humid conditions, causing large portions of the leaf to dry and die, giving the field a burnt appearance. Nodal blast presents as black lesions girdling the nodes, leading to stem breakage and death of the upper plant parts. Internodal infection can cause white, empty panicles, mimicking yellow stem borer or drought damage. Neck blast causes grayish-brown lesions around the neck of the panicle, often leading to breakage or poor grain development, especially if infection occurs before the milky stage. Lesions can also form on panicle branches and spikelets. Effective management includes using resistant varieties, seed treatment with Carbendazim or Tricyclazole at 2–3 g/kg seed, and adopting good agronomic practices such as proper spacing, avoiding excess nitrogen, good drainage, and removing infected crop residues. At the first appearance of symptoms, apply fungicides such as Tricyclazole 75% WP at 120 g/acre, Isoprothiolane 40% EC at 300 ml/acre, or Azoxystrobin 23% SC at 200 ml/acre, diluted in 200 liters of water per acre.

Symptoms appear on leaves, nodes, panicles, and glumes. On leaves, small bluish-green flecks develop into characteristic spindle-shaped spots with grey centers and dark brown margins, known as leaf blast. These spots can merge under humid conditions, causing large portions of the leaf to dry and die, giving the field a burnt appearance. Nodal blast presents as black lesions girdling the nodes, leading to stem breakage and death of the upper plant parts. Internodal infection can cause white, empty panicles, mimicking yellow stem borer or drought damage.

The major weeds seen in paddy fields include grassy weeds such as Echinochloa colona (jungle rice) and Dinebra retroflexa, sedges such as Cyperus iria (motha or rice flat sedge), and broadleaf weeds like Commelina benghalensis and Alternanthera sessilis, which are serious problems during the rainy season rice crop. To manage weeds in paddy fields, an integrated weed management (IWM) approach combining cultural, mechanical, and chemical measures is recommended. Maintain shallow standing water (2–5 cm) after transplanting to suppress most grassy and broadleaf weeds naturally, and always use certified, disease-free seeds. Carry out hand weeding at 15–20 days after transplanting (DAT) and again at 35–40 DAT. This is very effective but labour-intensive. Use tools such as a cono weeder or rotary weeder in transplanted paddy for effective control of weeds in early stages. Plough the field with a rotavator or cultivator to achieve fine tilth, remove weeds and stubbles, and ensure proper leveling for uniform germination and crop stand. In heavily weed-infested areas, follow stale seed bed technique, in this method allow weeds to germinate before sowing, then kill them with shallow tillage or by spraying a non-selective herbicide such as glyphosate or paraquat at least 10 days before sowing. This method greatly reduces weed pressure in DSR. Cultural and mechanical methods alone are often insufficient, so use chemical herbicides for effective weed control. Spray pre-emergence herbicides(within 2-3 days of sowing(DSR rice)/transplanting) such as Pretilachlor 50 EC @ 600 ml in 200 litres of water per acre or Butachlor 50 EC 1200 ml per acre in 200 litres of water on standing water for controlling grassy weeds and Echinochloa Chlona (jungle rice).

Apply 6-7 kg blue blue-green algae at 20 days after sowing or transplanting because it fixes atmospheric nitrogen, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers. It also improves soil fertility and promotes healthy crop growth. Monitor pest populations such as stem borers, leaf folders, and diseases like blast and bacterial blight. Implement integrated pest management with biological controls and judicious insecticide use. Timely application of herbicides like Pretilachlor or Pendimethalin in early crop stages, combined with manual weeding or mechanical weeders, reduces yield losses caused by weeds.","https://www.jnkvv.org/

The following are some of the most popular and newly recommended varieties for cultivation in Madhya Pradesh. JR 206: Developed by Jawaharlal Nehru Krishi Vishwa Vidyalaya (JNKVV), Jabalpur, this variety is a new and promising choice. It's suitable for the entire rice-growing area of the state, with a maturity period of about 120 days. JR 10: Another recommended variety from JNKVV, known for its adaptability to the entire state and a maturity period of around 120 days. It allows farmers to grow a second crop like lentil or chickpea after its harvest. Swarna (MTU 7029): This is a widely popular ""mega variety"" known for its stable, high yield and adaptability. It has excellent resistance to various biotic stresses and is a preferred choice for farmers across different regions. MTU 1010 (Jaya): A high-yielding variety that is very popular in many parts of the country, including Madhya Pradesh. It is known for its excellent yield potential and wide adaptability. Chinnor: A traditional, aromatic, and high-quality rice variety native to the Balaghat district of Madhya Pradesh. It has a Geographical Indication (GI) tag and is highly sought after for its distinct fragrance and softness. JRB-1: This variety has been shown to perform well in irrigated conditions, offering superior yield compared to older, traditional varieties. JR-81: Similar to JRB-1, this variety is also recommended for irrigated areas due to its higher yield potential. The average yield of paddy in Madhya Pradesh can vary widely based on the variety, soil type, and management. practices. The state's average yield is typically around 12-16 quintals per acre. With improved varieties and better management, farmers can achieve yields of 25-30 quintals per acre. Some of the newly released varieties, like JR 10, have a reported yield potential of 50-55 quintals per hectare, which translates to 20-22 quintals per acre. The ideal spacing for paddy depends on the cultivation method (transplanting or direct seeding) and the variety. Transplanting Method: 20-25 cm x 10-15 cm (Rows x Plants).

The first and most effective practice is to irrigate the field one day before frost is expected, because wet soil holds heat and keeps the crop safe. You also protect the crop by making smoke around field boundaries at night by burning husk, straw, or dry leaves, which traps heat near the ground and delays frost formation. Another simple method is dew removal – two people can run ropes gently over the crop in the early morning to shake off dew drops, so frost cannot damage leaves.

The best practice is to give half nitrogen and the full dose of phosphorus and potash at sowing time, so the crop starts strong, and then apply the remaining half nitrogen at the first irrigation, around 30–35 days after sowing, to boost tiller growth. Always remember, balanced nutrition keeps the crop stronger against disease and stress, and if you overuse or underuse, it reduces profit and harms soil health. If soil testing shows zinc deficiency, apply Zinc Sulphate 10 kg per acre, and you can also give 2% urea spray (4 kg urea in 200 liters of water per acre) at tillering or booting stage for quick nitrogen supply. Use balanced water management: 4-6 irrigations depending on rainfall and soil type.

A common issue faced is the yellowing of wheat crops, a symptom of stress rather than a single disease. Accurately identifying the cause is essential for effective treatment. Carefully observe the pattern of yellowing in the field. If the leaves show distinct yellow stripes parallel to the veins and release a yellow-orange powder when touched, the crop is likely suffering from Yellow Rust (Pili Kungi). This is a fungal disease that requires immediate attention. If the yellowing is uniform across the leaves without any stripes, it is likely a nutrient deficiency. If the yellowing starts on the lower, older leaves and moves upwards, it indicates a Nitrogen Deficiency. Conversely, if it appears on the upper, newer leaves, it points to a Sulphur Deficiency. Yellowing can also appear in scattered patches throughout the field. This could be due to Zinc Deficiency, characterized by yellowing between the veins of the middle leaves, or it could be a sign of waterlogging in low-lying areas after heavy rain. Once the cause is identified, the correct treatment can be applied. For Yellow Rust, an immediate fungicide spray is critical. A recommended dosage is 200 ml of Propiconazole 25% EC or Tebuconazole 250 EC mixed in 200 liters of water per acre. The best long-term prevention is to sow rust-resistant varieties of wheat. Nitrogen Deficiency is corrected by applying Urea as a top dressing. As per PAU recommendations, farmers should apply 55 kg of Urea per acre with the first irrigation and another 55 kg with the second irrigation. For Sulphur Deficiency, using Single Super Phosphate (SSP) at the time of sowing is the best preventive method. If the deficiency is observed later, a foliar spray of 1 kg of Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate (21%) mixed in 200 liters of water can help. Zinc Deficiency requires a specific spray solution: 1 kg of Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate (21%) and 500 grams of unslaked lime mixed in 200 liters of water per acre. The lime is vital to prevent the leaves from scorching. Finally, for waterlogging, there is no chemical solution; the only remedy is to drain the excess water from the field as quickly as possible to restore proper aeration to the plant roots.",https://www.pau.edu/content/wheat/package_of_practices https://iiwbr.icar.gov.in/ideasease/ https://iiwbr.icar.gov.in/nutrientmanagement/ https://kvk.icar.gov.in/KVKs-of-mp.html https://niphm.gov.in/IPMPackages/WheatRusts.html https://ppqs.gov.in/divisions/cib-rc/information-system-pesticide-registration,"Wheat, a vital Rabi (winter) crop in Madhya Pradesh, is typically sown between October and November and harvested from March to April.

A common issue faced is the yellowing of wheat crops, a symptom of stress rather than a single disease. Accurately identifying the cause is essential for effective treatment. Carefully observe the pattern of yellowing in the field. If the leaves show distinct yellow stripes parallel to the veins and release a yellow-orange powder when touched, the crop is likely suffering from Yellow Rust (Pili Kungi). This is a fungal disease that requires immediate attention. If the yellowing is uniform across the leaves without any stripes, it is likely a nutrient deficiency. If the yellowing starts on the lower, older leaves and moves upwards, it indicates a Nitrogen Deficiency. Conversely, if it appears on the upper, newer leaves, it points to a Sulphur Deficiency. Yellowing can also appear in scattered patches throughout the field. This could be due to Zinc Deficiency, characterized by yellowing between the veins of the middle leaves, or it could be a sign of waterlogging in low-lying areas after heavy rain. Once the cause is identified, the correct treatment can be applied. For Yellow Rust, an immediate fungicide spray is critical. A recommended dosage is 200 ml of Propiconazole 25% EC or Tebuconazole 250 EC mixed in 200 liters of water per acre. The best long-term prevention is to sow rust-resistant varieties of wheat. Nitrogen Deficiency is corrected by applying Urea as a top dressing.

In the Zaid season (March–June), the weather is hot and dry with limited water availability, which makes it unsuitable for paddy cultivation. An integrated approach using cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods is the most effective way to control weeds in paddy. Many weeds can be controlled by applying pre-sowing irrigation to area where nursery or seedlings are to be transplanted. The emerged weeds can be ploughed under.  For chemical control, apply herbicides like Metsulfuron Methyl 10 + Chlorimuron ethyl 10 WP at 8 g/acre or Anilophos 24 + 2,4-D- ethyl ester 32 EC at 400-600 ml/acre at 3-10 days after transplanting.

Dange,"Leaf yellowing in wheat is a common issue in the Madhya Pradesh region and can be caused by several factors. The two primary causes are nutrient deficiencies and fungal diseases. If the yellowing begins on the older, lower leaves and moves upward, it is likely a nitrogen deficiency. For this,a top dressing of urea is recommended. The application dose is 20 to 25 kilograms of urea/acre. Apply the urea and then provide light irrigation to help it incorporate into the soil. A single application is usually sufficient if the problem is addressed early. If the yellowing appears between the veins on the middle leaves, it may indicate a zinc deficiency. For this,a foliar spray is the most effective solution. Use zinc sulphate heptahydrate at a rate of 1.0 to 1.5 kilograms/acre. Dissolve the zinc in 200 liters of water for spraying. Apply two sprays,with the second application coming 15 to 20 days after the first. If the yellowing appears as stripes of powdery pustules or irregular spots, a fungal disease like yellow rust is the cause. For curative control,a fungicide like tebuconazole and trifloxystrobin combination is effective. The application dose is 150 to 200 ml/acre,mixed in 200 liters of water.

For this, a foliar spray is the most effective solution. Use zinc sulfate heptahydrate at a rate of 1.0 to 1.5 kilograms/acre. Dissolve the zinc in 200 liters of water for spraying. Apply two sprays, with the second application coming 15 to 20 days after the first. If the yellowing appears as stripes of powdery pustules or irregular spots, a fungal disease like yellow rust is the cause. For curative control, a fungicide like a tebuconazole and trifloxystrobin combination is effective. The application dose is 150 to 200 ml/acre, mixed in 200 liters of water. A single spray is often enough, but a follow-up application after 15 days may be needed for severe cases. For a protective spray against fungal diseases, mancozeb can be used. The application dose is 400 to 500 grams/acre, mixed in 200 liters of water. Sprays should be repeated every 10 to 15 days if the weather remains cool and humid.",https://iiwbr.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Wheat-Crop-Health-Newsletter-Febuary-2024.pdf https://www.kribhco.net/zns.html https://iiwbr.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Advisory-to-wheat-farmers-January-1-15-2025.pdf

Apply urea (46% N) at 50 kg/acre as top dressing and foliar spray of 1% urea (10 g per liter of water) for quick correction. Zinc deficiency-yellow streaks on younger leaves, stunted plants, often seen in waterlogged fields. Iron deficiency—new leaves turn pale yellow, but veins remain green (interveinal chlorosis). The soil application rate is 10 kg/acre of zinc sulfate. Foliar spray of ferrous sulfate (FeSO₄) 1% solution (10 g/liter). Pest infestation—Brown Planthopper (BPH), Leaf Folder, etc. Symptoms: Yellowing due to sap sucking or leaf damage. Spray Imidacloprid 17.8 SL at 40-50 ml/acre in 200 liters of water.

Dange,"White grubs are the larval stage of scarab beetles and are serious soil-dwelling pests of paddy. They feed on the roots of rice plants,causing reduced nutrient uptake, stunted growth, yellowing, and even plant death. Effective management requires an Integrated Pest Management approach combining cultural, biological, and chemical methods. Chemical control is most effective when targeted at the early larval stages,coinciding with pre-monsoon rains or soon after transplanting. Imidacloprid 17.8%SL is recommended at a dose of 80-100ml/acre. It should be applied as a soil drench using 200-250 liters of water/acre. A single application is often sufficient,but a second may be needed after 15-20 days if infestation persists. Seed treatment with Imidacloprid 17.8 SL at 3 ml/kg of seed is a highly effective preventive measure. Chlorantraniliprole 18.5%SC is another effective option applied at 60-80 ml/acre as a soil drench. It provides long residual control and is generally safer for beneficial insects. Thiamethoxam 25%WG can be used at 80-100 grams/acre applied as a soil drench during peak adult activity. For a bio-rational approach, a combination of Metarhizium anisopliae fungus (2.5 kg) with a reduced rate of Imidacloprid (8 ml) mixed with FYM and broadcast per acre is highly effective. Always ensure the field has adequate soil moisture at the time of application for the insecticide to reach the root zone. Apply all chemicals during the evening hours to minimize degradation and target the pest when it is most active. Cultural controls like deep summer plowing to expose grubs and setting up light traps to catch adult beetles are crucial.

The recommended fungicide for effective seed treatment are: Thiram 75 WP @ 3 gram/kg seeds or Thiram 2 gram + Mancozeb 1 gram per kg seed or Carbendazim 12% + Mancozeb 63% WP @  2gram per kg of seed. If you want to use biological option, you can use Trichoderma viride @ 4-6 grams per kg seed or Pseudomonas fluorescens@ 5-10 grams per kg of seed.

So it is necessary to treat seeds with rhizobium culture after fungicide and pesticide treatment to ensure that the plants get enough nitrogen for healthy growth, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers. After chemical treatments have dried, prepare a 10% jaggery (gur) solution (100 g jaggery in 1 litre water) to use as a sticker for biofertilizers. or every 10–12 kg of seed, use 200–250 g of Rhizobium culture and 200–250 g of PSB culture. Sprinkle the cultures over the seeds with the jaggery solution and mix gently until uniformly coated. Spread the treated seed in a thin layer in the shade and dry for about 30 minutes; do not dry in direct sunlight. Sow the treated seed on the same day to preserve the viability of Rhizobium and PSB. If you use Trichoderma viride or Pseudomonas fluorscens for seed treatment, do not apply chemical fungicide to same seed lot.

Dange,"Weed management in wheat is crucial as uncontrolled weeds can cause significant yield losses by competing for nutrients, water, and light. An integrated approach using cultural, mechanical, and chemical methods is most effective for the MP region. The choice of herbicide depends on the predominant type of weeds in your field, whether they are broadleaf weeds or grassy weeds. For broad-spectrum control, a pre-emergence application is often recommended. Apply Pendimethalin 30%EC at a dose of 800-1000 ml/acre. This herbicide should be applied immediately after sowing but before the germination of the wheat crop. It must be mixed in 120-150 liters of water/acre for uniform spraying. Pendimethalin is effective against a range of annual grasses and broadleaf weeds. For post-emergence control of grassy weeds like Wild Oat and Phalaris minor, specific herbicides are used. Clodinafop - propargyl 15%WP is an effective choice against grassy weeds. The recommended dose is 140-160 grams/acre. It should be applied when weeds are in the 2-4 leaf stage,typically 30-35 days after sowing. Mix the herbicide in 120-150 liters of water/acre for application. The waiting period for this herbicide is 30-40 days. For the control of broadleaf weeds like Chenopodium and Mustard, use 2,4-D Ethyl Ester 38% EC. The recommended dose is 300-400 ml/acre. Application should be done 35-40 days after sowing,during the active growth stage of the weeds. It must be mixed in 120-150 liters of water. The waiting period for 2,4-D is 40-45 days. A ready-mix herbicide like Metsulfuron - methyl 10% + Chlorimuron - ethyl 10% WP can control both grassy and broadleaf weeds. The dose for this mix is 20 grams/acre. Apply it for 30-35 days after sowing,mixed in 120-150 liters of water. The waiting period is 40-45 days. Always use a flat fan nozzle for uniform spray coverage and avoid spraying on windy days to prevent drift. Ensure the field has sufficient moisture at the time of herbicide application for best results. Adhering to the recommended waiting period is essential to ensure that pesticide residues are within safe limits at harvest.",https://www.rvskvv.net/PDF/package-of-practices/Wheat.pdf https://iiwbr.icar.gov.in/PDF/Weed%20Management.pdf,"Weed management in wheat is crucial as uncontrolled weeds can cause significant yield losses by competing for nutrients, water, and light.

The economic threshold for intervention is reached when the aphid population reaches 10-15 aphids per earhead or an average of 20-25 aphids per tiller. If the aphid population exceeds the economic threshold, a targeted foliar spray of a systemic insecticide is required. Imidacloprid 17.8% SL: A highly effective systemic insecticide at a dose of 50-60 ml per acre. Apply a single spray once the economic threshold is reached. Or Thiamethoxam 25% WG: Another systemic insecticide with excellent efficacy against aphids, at a dose of 40 grams per acre. Always mix these insecticides in 200 liters of water per acre for proper coverage. Apply in the evening to protect beneficial insects and pollinators.",https://iiwbr.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WHEAT-CROP-HEALTH-NEWSLETTER-FEB.-2025.pdf https://iiwbr.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EB-52-Wheat-Cultivation-in-India-Pocket-Guide.pdf https://iiwbr.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DWR-Perspective-Plan-Vision-2025.pdf

An integrated nematode management strategy is the most effective and sustainable approach. Practice crop rotation with non-host crops like mustard or chickpea for at least one season. This breaks the nematode's life cycle effectively. Perform summer deep plowing to expose the nematodes and their cysts to the sun. Use resistant or tolerant wheat varieties where available. Apply well-decomposed farmyard manure at 5 to 6 tonnes per acre to encourage natural enemies. Use bio-control agents like Paecilomyces lilacinus fungus at 1 to 2 kg/acre mixed with FYM. Chemical control should be considered a last resort if nematode populations are very high. These are best applied as soil treatments at or before sowing. Recommended chemical options include Carbofuran 3% CG granules at 16 to 17 kg/acre. Apply the granules evenly in the soil during the last plowing or in furrows at sowing. Another option is Phorate 10 percent CG granules at 4 to 5 kg/acre. Apply in the same manner as carbofuran. It is important to note that liquid nematicides are highly toxic and generally not recommended for wheat. The granular formulations are more practical options.

Suitable soils are medium black soil and loamy soil.

Seed & Varieties: Seed rate depends on the method: SRI – 2 kg/acre, Transplanting – 5 kg/acre, Pots – 10–12 kg/acre. Early maturing varieties (Attendees, Danteshwari) yield 12–15 qt/acre, medium duration varieties (Pusa Sugandh 3 & 4, MTU-1010, IR-36) yield 20–22 qt/acre, and hybrids (JRH-5, JRH-8, PRH-10, Sahyadri, Arize series) yield 26–28 qt/acre. Choose varieties based on land type and irrigation availability.

Sowing & Transplanting: Best time is mid-June to first week of July. Row sowing: 20 cm spacing; transplanting: 2–3 week-old seedlings, 2–3 per hill. Geometry: early – 15×15 cm, medium – 20×15 cm, late – 25×20 cm.

Seed Treatment & Bio-fertilizers: Treat seeds with Carbendazim or Carbendazim + Mancozeb (approx. 2–3 g/kg seed). Apply 5 kg Azospirillium/Azotobacter + PSB with 50 kg compost per acre. Twenty days after transplanting, apply 6 kg blue-green algae per acre in 3 cm water.

Nutrient Management: Apply 2–4 tons compost or cow dung/acre. For green manure, sow Sunai or Dhaincha at 10 kg/acre one month before transplanting.

Apply nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash as per irrigation level. 

For unirrigated crops, Urea 19 kg, DAP 40 kg, and MOP 0 kg; and for semi-irrigated (16:18:0 NPK) that is Urea: 29 kg, DAP: 59 kg.

For irrigated urea: 58 kg, DAP: 119 kg, and MOP 24 kg (48:54:14 g NPK). Use zinc sulfate 10 kg/acre after every three crops to correct micronutrient deficiencies. Adopting integrated crop, nutrient, weed, and pest management ensures higher yield, reduces input costs, and maintains soil fertility sustainably.",https://iiwbr.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EB-52-Wheat-Cultivation-in-India-Pocket-Guide.pdf https://dwr.org.in/Downloads/Information_Bulletin/Information%20Bulletin%20No%20-%2022%20-%20Herbicide%20Use%20in%20Indian%20Agriculture.pdf https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ganesh-Kumar-Koutu/publication/372514968_A_COMPENDIUM_OF_TRANSFERABLE_TECHNOLOGY-2023_JAWAHARLAL_NEHRU_KRISHI_VISHWA_VIDYALAYA_JNKVV_JABALPUR/links/64bb6935c41fb852dd8f9e7b/A-COMPENDIUM-OF-TRANSFERABLE-TECHNOLOGY-2023-JAWAHARLAL-NEHRU-KRISHI-VISHWA-VIDYALAYA-JNKVV-JABALPUR.pdf https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/agronomy/articles/10.3389/fagro.2022.914091/full

To ensure robust and high-yielding wheat, several management practices are recommended. Apply fertilizers based on soil test results. Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) are particularly important for wheat growth. Deficiencies in micronutrients like Sulfur (S), Iron (Fe), and Zinc (Zn) can also hamper growth. In some cases, yellowing can be a sign of sulfur deficiency, which is often confused with nitrogen deficiency.

Over-irrigation can lead to waterlogging and yellowing of the crop. Yellowness (chlorosis) in wheat can be caused by various factors, from nutrient deficiencies to diseases and pests. Nitrogen (N) Deficiency: This is the most common cause of yellowing. The symptoms typically appear first on the oldest (lower) leaves, as nitrogen is a mobile nutrient and the plant moves it to newer growth. Apply supplemental nitrogen fertilizer, such as urea or urea ammonium nitrate solution, as a top dressing. Sulfur (S) Deficiency: This can look similar to nitrogen deficiency, but it appears on the younger (upper) leaves first, as sulfur is an immobile nutrient. Apply a sulfur-containing fertilizer like gypsum, or a fertilizer like ammonium sulfate, which contains both nitrogen and sulfur. Yellow Rust (Stripe Rust): This is a fungal disease that can be devastating for wheat. It causes bright yellow, elongated stripes of spores on the leaves.

Chemical control starts with seed treatment using Carboxin + Thiram (e.g., Vitavax Power) at 250 g per quintal of seed, or Metalaxyl (Apron XL 35 SD) at 2 g/kg, Tebuconazole 2% DS at 1.5 g/kg, Captan 70% WS at 2 g/kg, or Carbendazim 50% WP at 2 g/kg (to be used under expert guidance) In field conditions where infection is visible, apply a soil drench using Carbendazim 50% WP at 500 g/ac Integrating these chemical measures with cultural practices gives the most effective control of wheat root rot.",https://iiwbr.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EB-52-Wheat-Cultivation-in-India-Pocket-Guide.pdf https://epubs.icar.org.in/index.php/AAR/article/view/146668 https://dwr.org.in/Downloads/Information_Bulletin/Information%20Bulletin%20No%20-%2022%20-%20Herbicide%20Use%20in%20Indian%20Agriculture.

First, after harvest, plough the previous ratoon crop deeply and remove grassy weeds or wild rice around the field because they act as host plants. Do not do staggered planting; try to finish sowing within 3 weeks, and prefer early planting with early-maturing resistant varieties like Bhadrakali, Pavitra, Panchami, Indursamba, Vasundhara, Shaktiman, Divya, Suraksha, Rashmi, Karna Mahavir, Rajendradhan 202, Birsa Dhan 202 and others which are available in Madhya Pradesh. Apply nitrogen and potash in split doses, avoid excess nitrogen as it increases pest attack. In nursery, clip the tips of seedlings before transplanting to reduce pest carryover, remove and burn infested plants, and if possible, use coir rope to drag over crop and drop insects into kerosinized water (0.40 litre kerosene mixed with 10.1 kg soil per acre) ).

The wheat should be thoroughly cleaned to remove impurities such as dirt, stones, and broken grains, which can harbour pests. Storage areas must be clean, dry, well-ventilated, and free from cracks to avoid pest entry and moisture buildup. Using new, clean gunny bags or airtight containers is recommended, and old grains should not be mixed with new stock. Cracks and crevices in walls or floors should be repaired to block pest entry, and good ventilation should be ensured to maintain a cool and dry environment, as excess humidity encourages spoilage. It is important to use only new, clean gunny bags or airtight containers for storing wheat and to avoid mixing old grain stocks with new harvests to minimize the risk of infestation.

These dealers represent well-known brands such as VST Tillers, Kubota, Mahindra, John Deere, and Yanmar. Alternatively, farmers can procure these machines through the MP State Agro Industries Development Corporation Ltd. or by applying via official government schemes designed to promote agricultural mechanization. A significant subsidy is available for purchasing a paddy transplanter under the Central Sector Scheme for the promotion of agricultural mechanization. The subsidy rate is set at fifty percent of the machine's cost. This financial support is subject to a ceiling limit of one point two five lakh rupees for a standard four-row paddy transplanter. The subsidy scheme is available to individual farmers, Custom Hiring Centers, and Farmer Producer Organizations. The price of a paddy transplanter varies considerably based on its type and features. A basic manual walk-behind model typically ranges from one point five to two point five lakh rupees. A more advanced four-row riding type transplanter can cost between three point 500000 to 650000 rupees. After applying the maximum subsidy, the effective out-of-pocket cost for a four-row machine would be approximately two point seven five lakh rupees for a model priced at four lakh rupees. The area a transplanter can cover depends on its type. A manual walk-behind transplanter operated by a single person can cover approximately zero point three to zero point four acres in a full day. A four-row riding type machine is significantly more efficient, capable of transplanting two to three acres per day during an eight to ten hour operating period. The application process for the subsidy is conducted online through the official MP State Agro Portal. Farmers must first register on the portal using their personal and land details. After registration, they can log in, locate the agricultural mechanization subsidy section, and select the paddy transplanter from the list of available implements. The application requires uploading necessary documents for verification by district agricultural officers.

",TRUE,-,,"Paddy is mainly grown in the Kharif season. Controlling zinc deficiency in paddy (rice) is essential to prevent 'Khaira Disease,' a condition that causes rusty brown or bronze discolouration of leaves starting from the base, leading to stunted and uneven growth, which significantly reduces yields. The most effective way to manage this deficiency is through soil application of zinc, primarily using Zinc Sulphate Heptahydrate (ZnSO4·7H2O), which contains 21% elemental zinc.

The use of the term ""fodder yield"" in the first sentence is the biggest clue. While wheat straw is used as fodder, the primary objective of wheat cultivation is grain yield. The entire irrigation schedule provided seems geared towards maximizing plant biomass (fodder) rather than optimizing grain development.
The schedule for one irrigation is not ideal. While applying it at 40–45 days is better than nothing, the single most critical stage for wheat is the Crown Root Initiation (CRI) stage (20–25 days after sowing).

Make sure machines are well maintained—keep the silencer mouth facing upward, check for oil leaks, and do not overheat engines while working. Do not burn wheat straw; instead, use it as fodder or for mulching the field to improve soil health. Make small firebreaks (empty strips of land) around the field and always keep watch during harvest time when the weather is dry and windy. Keep a few buckets of water, soil, or a small fire extinguisher nearby to quickly stop any small fire before it spreads. If a fire happens, first turn off all engines and machines close to the fire so it does not get bigger, move tractors or tools away from the fire, and call local fire services if the fire cannot be controlled. By following these simple steps carefully, you can protect your wheat crop, save your life, and secure your income from unexpected fire loss. Always work carefully in hot and dry conditions and stay alert.",https://extension.oregonstate.edu/catalog/pub/em-9326-preventing-responding-combine-fires https://iiwbr.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/EB-52-Wheat-Cultivation-in-India-Pocket-Guide.pdf https://iiwbr.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Advisory-to-wheat-farmers-January-1-15-2025.pdf

Yes, you can sow wheat after harvesting peas, as peas are a legume crop that enriches the soil with nitrogen and improves fertility. This helps the wheat crop grow better. But you should prepare the field properly after the pea harvest by doing light tillage, conserving soil moisture, and sowing wheat at the right time so that the crop is not delayed. This crop rotation is good for both soil health and yield. In general, peas are sown after the harvest of Kharif crops.

https://irac-online.org/modes-of-action/","Demak / Loose smut It is a seed-borne fungal disease affecting wheat crops in Punjab. The disease appears at the flowering stage, replacing grains with black powdery spores. Since the fungus grows internally within the seed, prevention through seed treatment is crucial. Several wheat varieties show resistance to loose smut in Punjab conditions, like HD 2967, which demonstrates moderate resistance against the disease. PBW 725 offers good resistance to both loose smut and rust diseases. WH 1105 shows tolerance to smut and other foliar diseases. PBW 550, recommended for Punjab, provides moderate resistance. Always use certified seeds from your retailer shop. Also, you can use Carboxin 37.5% + Thiram 37.5% WS (Vitavax Power) 2 gm/kg of seed. Tebuconazole 2% DS (Raxil 2 DS) works effectively at 1.5 gm/kg of seed, controlling both loose smut and bunt.

They attack mostly in late crop stages, especially when the weather is cool and dry. If not controlled in time, aphids can reduce grain size and final yield. To control aphids in wheat, spray Thiamethoxam 25% WG @ 100 gram per acre or Imidacloprid 17.8% SL @ 100 ml per acre, mixed in 200 liters of water. These are easily available in Haryana and give good results.

For better results, spray in the morning or evening when wind is low. As an alternative, also you can use Flonicamid 50% WG @60 gram per acre in 200 litres of water for good control and better resistance. As a safer option and for bio control, you can also use Neem-based insecticide (Azadirachtin 1500 ppm) @ 300-400 ml per acre in 200 litres of water. Rotate chemicals every season to avoid resistance. Keep the field clean after harvest to reduce future pest attack. Along with spraying, also practice cultural methods like removing weeds around the field and destroying aphid-infested plant parts.

This also makes your crop more susceptible to diseases and pests because when we apply excess nitrogen fertilizer to crops, the plants grow very fast and produce soft, lush, and tender leaves. These tender leaves contain more sap, amino acids, and sugars, which act like “ready food” for many sucking pests such as aphids, whiteflies, jassids, and leafhoppers, as well as for caterpillars. Because the plant tissues remain soft, pests can easily suck or chew them, and the crop becomes more attractive to attacks. Furthermore, excessive nitrogen can harm the quality of your soil by increasing its acidity and reducing its overall health over time, potentially leading to deficiencies in other vital nutrients for your crops. It can even lead to nitrate leaching, contaminating groundwater which can affect human and animal health. To prevent these issues, it is always best to base your nitrogen application on soil tests and follow the recommended doses for your specific region and wheat variety, including using balanced and integrated nutrient management with both organic and inorganic sources of nutrients.

https://www.pau.edu/content/ccil/pf/pp_rabi.pdf","The time to avoid irrigation depends mainly on the crop, soil type, growth stage, and weather, but in general, it is advisable not to irrigate just before or after certain critical events like immediately after fertilizer or pesticide application (unless it’s meant to be incorporated). it is required to wait at least 24 hours to prevent nutrient loss or chemical wash-off.  For Urea, irrigation must be applied immediately after broadcasting to dissolve the granules and prevent significant nitrogen loss to the atmosphere.

 Irrigation decisions must always be crop-specific. In paddy, irrigation should be avoided at the time of grain ripening, since excess water at maturity delays harvest and lowers grain quality. 
In onion, over-irrigation during the maturity and bulb-drying stage should be avoided, as it reduces storability and causes rotting.
 For mustard, irrigation must not be given at the flowering and pod-maturity stage, because excess moisture encourages diseases and shattering. In most vegetables, especially cucurbits and solanaceous crops, irrigation should be avoided during flowering and immediately before harvest, as water stress or excess moisture at these stages can either reduce fruit set or affect keeping quality. 

Before harvest of crops like paddy, groundnut, onion, or sugarcane  the usual practice is to stop irrigation for 7–15 days before harvest to allow proper drying and improve quality.
