The details of the scheme is available in this agrimachinerypb.com. Details regarding  the subsidy is available in the office of the Assistant Agricultural Engineer (AAE) in their local block or district.
 ",FALSE,"Critically Missing Subsidy Information: The biggest and most significant flaw is that the answer completely fails to mention that farmers in Punjab can get a substantial government subsidy for purchasing this machine. Giving only the full market price is highly misleading, as the actual cost to the farmer is much lower.

Missing Correct Information: An expert answer must include the specific details of the financial support available. It should state that under the Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM) scheme, a farmer can typically get a subsidy of 40% to 50% on the cost of the drill.

Missing the Actionable Step: The advice is incomplete as it doesn't tell the farmer how to get this benefit. A complete answer must specify that the farmer should apply for the subsidy through the office of the Assistant Agricultural Engineer (AAE) in their local block or district.

Impractical Units: The cost-saving is given in per hectare. To be practical for a farmer in Punjab, this should be converted to per acre (e.g., ₹2,500–3,000 per hectare is approximately ₹1,000–1,200 per acre).",,"Zero Tillage Drill is a handy machine that helps to sow seeds directly into unplowed soil without disturbing the previous crop residue, saving time and preserving moisture.

Other varieties, such as MSS-1, MSS-5, and Punjab Spearmint-1, are valued for their strong aroma and are widely used in medicinal and herbal products. Mint is usually propagated through root slips or stem cuttings, as seed propagation is less reliable and uncommon. When seed propagation is used, the recommended seed rate is 1–2 kg per acre. For vegetative propagation, about 600–800 kg of root slips or stem cuttings per acre is required to establish a good crop. Under proper agronomic practices, farmers can expect a fresh herb yield of 12–16 tonnes per acre. The essential oil yield typically ranges from 40 to 50 litres per acre, depending on the variety, soil fertility, and management.

The PHI (pre-harvesting interval) for barseem of emamecticn benzoate is 12-14 days, and for spinosad it is 2-3 days. It is recommended to apply insecticides only when pest infestation is severe; otherwise, use other mechanical and biological methods.","Sources:

The correct procedure is to first scrape away the affected bark area and then apply a Bordeaux paste or a specific fungicide paste directly to the wound.

First you’ll see small, round or uneven dark brown to black spots on the lower leaves. Slowly these spots grow bigger, making ring-like marks on leaves, stems, and even pods. Leaves start curling, drying, and falling early—this cuts the yield and the grains inside the pods stay light and poor in quality. Sometimes pods shrivel and seeds lose oil content. For control, don’t wait till the crop is badly hit—start preventive spraying around 40–45 days after sowing, at early flowering stage, especially when the weather is humid and mild. Use only approved sprays like: do foliar spray Propiconazole ( 25 EC) – 200 ml or Mancozeb 75% WP – 400 gm in 200 litres water (works best as protective spray) for per acre.

You may also apply NSKE (Neem Seed Kernel Extract) 5% or Azadirachtin 0.03% @ 400 ml per acre for eco-friendly control during early infestation stages. Spray insecticides when 2-3 folded leaves per plant are observed during the critical period of August -October. PAU recommended insecticides to control leaf folder are Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC @ 60 ml per acre (keep PHI gap 47 days) or Flubendiamide 39.35% M/M SC 20 g/acre (PHI 40 days) mix with 200-250 litres of water. Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to delay resistance and ensure long-term effectiveness. Alternatively also you may use Chlorpyriphos 20 EC 500 ml/ acre (PHI - 15 days), Cartap Hydrochloride 50 % SP 400 g/acre (PHI - 21 days) or Thiamethoxam 25% WG 40 g/acre (PHI- 14 days) mixed with 200 - 250 litres of water to ensure full coverage, Ensure proper dose, timing, and coverage as per guidelines for effective protection.. By following these steps, you can easily control the leaf folder in the paddy crop.","https://pau.edu/content/ccil/pf/pp_rabi.pdf

The best and safest way is to use the PAU-recommended biocontrol agent Trichoderma asperellum 2% WP — treat seed at 15 g per kg and before transplanting, dip seedling roots in a solution of 15 gram per litre of water for about 6 hours. This eco-friendly method gives long-lasting protection, keeps soil healthy, and leaves no harmful residues. If chemical control is needed, treat seed with Carbendazim and Mancozeb ( 75 WS) (it's a combined mix) @ 2.5–3 gram per kg seed as a slurry, or spray at 500–600 g per acre in 200 litres water at the first sign of disease (applied only under expert guidance as carbendazim have some restriction). As an alternative, Metalaxyl-M and Mancozeb (68 WP) @ 500 gram per acre in 200 litres of water can also be sprayed or used as a soil drench. Always maintain a PHI of 30–35 days after the last chemical spray before harvest for safe grain. Along with this, follow cultural practices — transplant in the second fortnight of July, keep fields well-drained to avoid standing water, avoid excess nitrogen, remove and destroy infected seedlings, and rotate with crops like wheat or maize to break the disease cycle. By combining biocontrol, timely approved fungicide use when required, and good field practices, you can control Foot Rot, keep your paddy healthy, get full yield, and fetch a good mandi price without risking grain safety.",http://www.agritech.pau.edu/ https://niphm.gov.in/IPMPackages/Rice.pdf/ https://ppqs.gov.in/en/divisions/cib-rc/major-uses-of-pesticides/ https://workdrive.zoho.in/file/7pdp39cbcfa4dc43441d49c0ad2c7a3d632ed,"In Punjab’s paddy (dhaan) fields,  Ziam is a ready-mix fungicide containing Hexaconazole 4% + Zineb 68% WP, and it works very well against stem rot caused by Sclerotium oryzae, plus it also helps control sheath blight and other fungal problems.

If Bathua comes later, at 25–30 days crop stage (3–5 leaf stage), spray Sulfosulfuron 75% WG @ 13.5 gram per acre or Metsulfuron-methyl 20% WP @ 8 gram per acre in 150–200 litres of water, for mixed weeds like Bathua and grassy weeds (Mandusi), one ready-combined mix spray of (commonly Sulfosulfuron 75% and Metsulfuron-methyl 5% WG) 16 gram per acre mixed in 150 to 200 liters of water for uniform spraying, works best and is cheaper. This dose controls both broadleaf and grassy weeds efficiently when applied at the early 3-5 leaf stage of wheat. As an alternative, you can use  Clodinafop-propargyl 15% WP and Metsulfuron-methyl 5% WP premix used as a post-emergence herbicide for grassy weed control. The typical recommended dose is approximately 30 grams per acre, mixed in 150-200 liters of water. Both these chemical controls should be applied carefully following label instructions for the best and safest weed management. Maintain a Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) of 30 days after herbicide application to ensure food safety.  For cultural control, do hand weeding when weeds are small, keep a good seed rate and proper crop spacing, and avoid using Bathua-infested manure. For biological control, use Trichoderma or bio-herbicide formulations at 2 kg can be mixed in about 200 to 300 liters of water per acre and applied to the soil, especially before or at the time of sowing. This helps suppress weed seed germination and soil-borne pathogens over time, or foliar spray use  3 grams in 200 liters of water per acre. Spray chemicals early morning or late evening for best effect, rotate herbicides to avoid resistance, and always buy from authorized dealers. By using this full approach—chemical at the right dose and time, cultural care, and biological help—wheat will grow clean, give a good yield, and save extra cost in the long run.",https://iiwbr.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/16-31-Jan-English.pdf https://iiwbr.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Major-Advisory-1-15-Feb-2025.pdf https://pau.edu/content/extserv/fo/12.pdf

Wheat is a rabi (winter) crop, sown between October and December and harvested from February to May. Weeds like Phalaris minor, Avena fatua, Poa annua (grassy weeds), Anagallis arvensis, Chenopodium album, and Billi buti (broadleaf weeds) can significantly reduce your wheat yield. Remove crop residue, weeds, and debris before planting to minimize hiding spots for weeds. Instead of growing wheat in the same spot repeatedly, switch to other crops (e.g., pulses). This disrupts weed cycles and helps reduce their populations over time. Make sure your wheat seeds are free of weed seeds. Phalaris minor in Punjab has developed resistance to commonly used herbicides like isoproturon. Effective options for controlling isoproturon-resistant P. minor include Clodinafop-propargyl or Sulfosulfuron.  For weeds like Anagallis arvensis and Chenopodium album, herbicides like Metsulfuron-methyl or 2,4-D are commonly used. Tank-mixing with grass-specific herbicides can provide broader control. Pre-emergence herbicides are applied after sowing to prevent weed germination. Post-emergence herbicides are applied when weeds are in the 2-3 leaf stage. Manual removal of weeds can be a useful supplementary method, especially if herbicide application is missed or delayed.

First, soak your seed in 1% Calcium Chloride (CaCl₂) solution for about 12 hours using 100–150 ml CaCl₂ in 10 litres of water—enough for one acre seed quantity. This makes seedlings tough, improves sprouting, and helps them handle dry or hot conditions.  After soaking, dry the seed back to its normal moisture in shade, then sow in well-prepared, well-drained nursery beds. As an alternative, you can soak in 1% Potassium Nitrate (KNO₃) or 1% Potassium Chloride (KCl) the same way about 100 to 150 ml of KNO₃ or KCl per 10 liters of water, enough to soak seeds for one acre. For a natural option, you can use Panchakavya 3% (Mix 3 liters of Panchakavya in 100 liters of water) For seed soaking or dipping seedlings before transplanting, soak for about 20 minutes or 10% cow dung water (Mix 10 liters of fresh, well-decomposed cow dung in 100 liters of water) Use it for seed soaking or nursery spraying as needed. Both these natural treatments help improve seedling vigor, root growth, and resistance naturally. In the nursery, apply 25 kg urea + 60 kg SSP + 40 kg zinc sulphate heptahydrate (21% Zn) per acre at sowing, then another 25 kg urea per acre after 15 days. Keep the nursery weed-free and give only light water; about 5–7 days before transplanting, reduce water so the soil top dries a bit—this “drying” step makes roots strong and cuts down transplant shock. Always use healthy seeds, keep seedlings 25–30 days old for transplanting, and follow PHI of 14–21 days for any chemical seed treatments like Cruiser 70 WS @ 1 g/kg seed or Raxil Easy 6 FS @ 13 ml/40 kg seed.

Paddy needs about 1300 to 1500 mm of water per crop cycle, which mostly comes from irrigation because rainfall is less here. To do proper water leaching, after puddling and transplanting, keep about 5–7 cm (2–3 inches) of standing water, let it soak in, and once the field dries on top, flood again. Doing this every 2–4 days flushes salts down and gives fresh water to the roots, this helps flush out salts and unwanted chemicals from the root zone.  Use flood irrigation but avoid keeping water stagnant for too long as it causes nutrient loss and poor root growth. For saving water and still getting good leaching, you can use Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) — put 5 cm water only when small cracks start showing in the soil. Always keep your field well-leveled with laser leveling so water spreads evenly.

Correction:

-PAU recommends Alternate Wetting & Drying (AWD): Irrigate when hairline cracks appear, not daily flooding.
-Water requirement in Punjab: ~1000–1200 mm, not 1500 mm (with PR 126, PR 121 etc.).

First, keep your field clean — remove weeds and nearby host crops like moong, okra, and even avoid planting cotton near vegetables or kinnow orchards, because these harbour whiteflies. After harvest, plough and destroy crop residues so pests can’t survive for next season. At the very first sign of whiteflies, spray PAU-approved insecticides such as Thiacloprid 21.7% SL @ 300 ml per acre or Acetamiprid 20 SP @ 100–150 gram per acre mixed in 200 litres of water.

Make field drains at 10–15 m intervals to remove standing water within 24 hours after rain. Ensure to use shallow surface drains leading to main channels or field bund outlets.

Another reason is nutrient deficiency, which causes low nitrogen or zinc deficiency and can cause slow growth. The solution is a foliar spray of 2% urea (20 g/L water) prepared by mixing  4 kg of urea in 200 litres of water for an acre, and spraying evenly on foliage. For zinc deficiency, spray 0.5% zinc sulphate + 0.25% slaked lime prepared by mixing 1 Kg Zinc sulphate and 500 grams of slaked lime in 200 litres of water for an acre. Dissolve zinc sulphate separately, mix in the spray tank, and add slaked lime solution last to avoid leaf burn. Another cause is root disease or nematode attack, which causes root rot, damping-off, or nematode damage to roots, limiting nutrient uptake. It can be managed by root zone drench with Copper oxychloride 3 g/L water, which is 600 grams in 200 litres of water. The pre-harvest interval of 15 days is needed in cotton to protect workers during subsequent field operations. Some methods to control Nematodes are Cultural Practices, such as Crop rotation with non-host crops (wheat, barley, maize, bajra) for 2–3 years to reduce nematode populations, and growing of Trap crops like marigold (Tagetes spp.) as a trap crop around cotton fields to suppress root-knot nematodes. Apply neem cake (250 kg/acre) with Trichoderma (2.5 kg/acre) mixed in FYM at sowing to control nematodes.","https://www.pau.edu/content/ccil/pf/pp_kharif.pdf https://www.niphm.gov.in/IPMPackages/Cotton.pdf

Symptoms include leaf blades showing reddish or purplish discolouration, starting from the tips or margins. In severe deficiency, leaves dry from the tips downward. Growth becomes stunted, and tillering is reduced. To prevent this nutrient deficiency, regular soil testing & monitoring of pH and nutrient levels are necessary to adjust fertilizer applications accordingly. Apply MOP @ 25 kg/acre as basal or early topdressing, apply SSP/DAP as per soil test, and avoid late planting in cool seasons and apply MOP @ 15-20 kg/acre if deficiency is observed during the active tillering stage. Apply Foliar 1% K₂SO₄ 10 g/l and avoid excess nitrogen without potash.","https://www.pau.edu/content/extserv/fo/4.pdf

In paddy, Copper Oxychloride (COC) is a widely used fungicide to control bacterial and fungal leaf diseases like bacterial leaf blight, sheath rot, and leaf spots. For best results, dissolve 2-3 gm per litre of water or 300-600 gm COC 50% WP per acre in about 200 litres of water and spray evenly, covering both sides of the leaves. Spraying should be done at the first appearance of disease symptoms and repeated at 10–12 day intervals if the disease persists.

While paddy is a major Kharif crop in Punjab, it's not usually cultivated during the Zaid season (March-June). Fertara (also known as Ferterra) is an insecticide used in paddy (rice) cultivation. Targeted pests are Yellow stem borer and Paddy leaf folder. It provides long-lasting control of key rice pests like stem borers and leaf folders. By controlling pests, it helps ensure healthier plants and potentially higher yields.

Physiological stresses such as subsoil salinity, light sandy soils, nitrogen deficiency, prolonged low humidity combined with warm and dry weather, and inadequate soil moisture during boll formation can hamper proper boll maturation. Adverse conditions like drought or irregular irrigation, nutritional imbalances, and poor soil health also contribute to the problem. Pest damage, particularly from pink bollworm, can directly affect boll development, while boll rot diseases lead to premature decay inside the bolls, preventing them from opening. To manage this problem, it is essential to ensure timely and consistent irrigation during flowering and boll formation stages. Crop residues should be removed and infested bolls destroyed to reduce pest and disease pressure. Avoid early sowing to reduce pest build up. For pest control, particularly bollworms, timely sowing before May 15 is recommended, along with crop residue destruction after harvest. Insecticide sprays such as Chlorantraniliprole 18.5% SC @ 60 ml per acre in 150–200 litres of water, or Fipronil 5 SC @ 400 ml per acre in 200–250 litres of water, should be applied as needed. Boll rot diseases also cause premature boll decay and prevent proper boll opening, to manage this proper field sanitation, avoid excessive irrigation especially during boll maturation, maintain balanced nutrient management to strengthen plant resilience against pathogens, and apply fungicides such as Propineb 70% WP @ 600 grams in 200 litres of water or Mancozeb 75% WP – 600 g in 200 litres of water.

This confirms if sulfur is really low and tells you how much to apply. Don’t grow wheat on the same field every year if your soil is low in sulfur. Rotate with pulses or other crops that can pull up more sulfur from deeper layers. Add well-rotted farmyard manure (FYM) 10 tones per acre every season to naturally improve sulfur availability and keep the soil alive. For natural or biological control Mix Trichoderma viride @ 2 kg per acre in moist compost and broadcast before sowing or after land prep.

Mix well into the top 4–6 inches of soil and irrigate. Gypsum not only gives sulfur but also adds calcium, improving soil structure. If deficiency shows during the crop, spray ammonium sulfate @ 2 kg per acre in 200 liters water at critical stages like tillering and jointing.

Neem-coated urea (NCU) @ 110–120 kg per acre can be applied as a split dose at the growth stage. Since NCU only increases nitrogen, combine it with gypsum or ammonium sulfate if your soil is low in sulfur. By combining soil testing, crop rotation, organic matter, beneficial microbes, gypsum application, quick foliar sprays, and modern sulfur-coated fertilizers, you can keep your wheat healthy, grains well-filled, and achieve high yields.",https://pau.edu/content/ccil/pf/pp_rabi.pdf https://pau.edu/content/extserv/fo/1.pdf https://desagri.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2016-17-Impact-of-Neem-Coated-Urea-on-Production-Productivity-and-Soil-Health-In-Punjab.pdf

Dange,"Rice is cultivated in the kharif season (June-July), where you should choose popular and better varieties like PR 126, a popular rice variety recommended for Punjab farmers. It requires 8-10 kg of seed/acre for direct seeding or 4-5 kg for transplanting methods. This variety yields 30-32 q/acre and matures in 123-125 days. Its key advantage includes resistance to bacterial leaf blight and suitability for late sowing conditions. PR 121 offers early maturation for water-saving cultivation. The seed rate is 7-9 kg/acre for direct seeding or 4 kg for transplanted crops. Farmers can expect yields of 28-30 q/acre from this variety. Its short duration of 111-115 days helps save about 30% irrigation water compared to longer duration varieties.
PR 124 stands out for its high yield potential among non-basmati varieties. It requires 8-10 kg of seed/acre across all planting methods. The variety produces 32-34 q/acre and takes 128-130 days to mature. Its strong stems provide good lodging resistance during storms.
Pusa Basmati 1509 represents the premium aromatic rice category. It needs only 4-5 kg of seed/acre but must be transplanted. The yield ranges between 18 and 20 q/acre due to its superior grain quality. This variety matures in 115-120 days and commands higher market prices.
Pusa Basmati 1692 offers improved basmati characteristics. With a low seed rate of 4 kg/acre, it yields 20-22 q/acre. The 125-day duration variety produces extra-long slender grains preferred in export markets. Its aroma and cooking quality make it valuable for specialty rice products.
HKR 47 leads in yield potential among hybrid varieties. It requires 6-8 kg of seed/acre for planting. Farmers can harvest 35-38 q/acre from this high-performing hybrid. The longer duration of 135-140 days requires careful water and nutrient management.

But currently it's banned, so avoid its use. For foliar spray applications, you should use 1-1.5 ml of chlorpyrifos 20% EC per litre of water for light infestation. Also, you can use it in granular form for soil-dwelling pests. The 1.5% GR formulation should be applied at 10-12 kg per acre. These granules should be broadcast uniformly in standing water for the best results against underground larvae. The first spray should be applied 20-25 days after transplanting when early pest activity appears.

For Mixed Weed Flora (Grasses, Broad-Leaved Weeds, and Sedges), you can use Bispyribac-sodium 10% SC @ 100ml per acre. Highly effective against grasses like Swank (Echinochloa), sedges like Motha (Cyperus), and many broad-leaved weeds. Best applied 20-30 days after transplanting when weeds are in the 2-4 leaf stage. Or Triafamone 20% + Ethoxysulfuron 10% WG @90g per acre. Provides excellent control over a wide range of grasses (including resistant Phalaris), sedges, and broad-leaved weeds.

This is wrong. The correct and official sowing window for cotton in Punjab is from April 1st to May 15th.

Critically Incorrect Seed Rates: The recommended seed rates are completely wrong and a major flaw:

The rate for Bt cotton varieties (4 Kg per acre) is double the standard rate.

The rate for Bt hybrids (1 Kg per acre) is too high; the packet size is typically 450-500 grams.

The rate for non-Bt varieties (3.5 Kg per acre) is also too high.

While it's the same fungus that causes leaf blast, it becomes particularly harmful when it attacks the ""neck"" of the panicle, the part of the plant that holds the grains. This infection effectively cuts off the flow of water and nutrients to the developing grains. The disease is most common during the panicle emergence stage, typically from late August to September in Punjab. It thrives in high humidity (above 90%), cool nights, and overcast conditions. Another contributing factor is the overuse of nitrogen fertilizer, which makes the plant more susceptible. The symptoms of neck blast are quite distinct. You'll notice a brownish to blackish lesion or ring on the neck of the panicle. This weakens the neck, often causing it to break, a condition known as ""rotten neck."" If the infection occurs early, the grains will remain empty and turn whitish, creating what farmers call ""white ears."" Later infections result in shriveled and poor-quality grains. To control neck blast, an integrated approach is essential, combining preventive measures with timely chemical sprays. Cultural practices are crucial; farmers should use balanced fertilization, avoiding excessive urea, and apply nitrogen in split doses.

This infection effectively cuts off the flow of water and nutrients to the developing grains. The disease is most common during the panicle emergence stage, typically from late August to September in Punjab. It thrives in high humidity (above 90%), cool nights, and overcast conditions. Another contributing factor is the overuse of nitrogen fertilizer, which makes the plant more susceptible. The symptoms of neck blast are quite distinct. You'll notice a brownish to blackish lesion or ring on the neck of the panicle. This weakens the neck, often causing it to break, a condition known as ""rotten neck."" If the infection occurs early, the grains will remain empty and turn whitish, creating what farmers call ""white ears."" Later infections result in shriveled and poor-quality grains.

The seed rate of PB-3 paddy is around 8–10 kg per acre when using a nursery and transplanting method. If you plan to do direct seeding, then the seed requirement is slightly higher, about 12–15 kg per acre. The average yield is about 14-15 quintals/acre, but since it is old and susceptible, PAU now recommends PB-1847, PB-7, PB-1718, etc. Instead of PB-3, use varieties like Pusa Basmati 1847 with an average yield of 19 quintals per acre, Punjab Basmati 7 with an average yield of 19 quintals per acre, Pusa Basmati 1718 with an average yield of 17 quintals per acre, Punjab Basmati 5 with an average yield of 15 quintals per acre, CSR 30 with an average yield of 13.5 quintals per acre, Pusa Basmati 1509 with an average yield of 15.7 quintals per acre, or Pusa Basmati 1121 with an average yield of 13.7 quintals per acre.

",TRUE,-,,"Paddy (rice) is mainly grown in the Kharif season (June-October) and not in Rabi because rice needs a hot and humid climate with plenty of water for its growth. During Kharif in Punjab and other parts of India, the monsoon rains provide abundant water, and the temperature remains 25–35°C, which is ideal for rice germination, tillering, and grain filling.

Dange,"Wheat crops often suffer from nutrient deficiencies that can significantly reduce yield and quality. There are several types of deficiency, like nitrogen deficiency, which is characterized by yellowing of older leaves and stunted growth. To control this, apply urea at 50–100 kg/acre in split doses, with half at sowing and half at tillering. A foliar spray of 2% urea solution (20 gm/liter of water) can also help.
Phosphorus deficiency leads to purple or reddish leaves and poor root development. Use DAP at 50–75 kg/acre as a basal application or SSP at 100–115 kg/acre. A foliar spray of 1–2% DAP solution (10–20 gm/liter of water) can be used if needed.
Potassium deficiency causes yellowing and browning of leaf edges and weak stems. Apply MOP at 25–50 kg/acre or SOP at 30–60 kg/acre. A foliar spray of 1% potassium sulfate (10 gm/liter of water) can correct deficiencies quickly.
Zinc deficiency results in interveinal chlorosis and white streaks on young leaves. Apply zinc sulfate at 10–20 kg/acre every 2–3 years, or use a foliar spray of 0.5% zinc sulfate (5 gm/liter of water) with lime to prevent leaf burn.
Iron deficiency shows as yellowing between veins in young leaves. A foliar spray of 0.5–1% ferrous sulfate (5–10 gm/liter of water) with citric acid improves absorption.
Sulfur deficiency causes uniform yellowing of young leaves and reduces grain protein. Apply gypsum at 50–100 kg/acre or ammonium sulfate at 25–50 kg/acre.
Boron deficiency leads to poor grain setting and hollow stems. Use borax at 2–5 kg/acre or a foliar spray of 0.2% borax (2 gm/liter of water) at flowering.
Magnesium deficiency causes yellowing between veins in older leaves. A foliar spray of 1% magnesium sulfate (10 gm/liter of water). 
For best results, conduct soil testing before applying fertilizers. A balanced NPK ratio of 120:60:40 kg per acre is recommended, adjusted based on soil test results.

",,PROVIDE FULL INFORMATION,,,information regarding pora method of aowing,-1,,16-8-2025,Tejas R. Dange,"The pora method is a traditional wheat sowing technique still practice in parts of this region, particularly for late-sown crops. This method involves broadcasting wheat seeds manually across a prepared field at a rate of 40-50 kg/acre. After seed scattering, farmers perform light plowing or harrowing to mix the seeds into the top 2-3 cm of soil. The key step involves dragging a wooden plank called a pora over the field to compact the soil and improve seed-to-soil contact. Immediate light irrigation follows to ensure proper germination.
This method offers several advantages for certain farming situations. It requires minimal equipment, making it accessible to small farmers without seed drills. The process is faster than mechanical drilling, which helps when sowing is delayed after paddy harvest. Pora works particularly well in light-textured sandy-loam soils where conventional drills may struggle. The soil compaction from planking helps retain moisture, which is beneficial in water-scarce conditions.
The pora method has significant limitations compared to modern techniques. It uses substantially more seed (40-50 kg/acre) compared to drill sowing (25-30 kg/acre). The uneven seed distribution often leads to patchy crop stands and variable plant density. Fertilizer application is less precise, reducing nutrient use efficiency. Weed pressure tends to be higher due to shallow seed placement and uneven field conditions.
The pora method works best in particular field conditions. Light-textured soils with good drainage are most suitable for this approach. The technique shows advantage when time is limited after paddy harvest and drill equipment isn't available. Small-scale farmers with limited resources may find it more practical than investing in seed drills. However, soil moisture at sowing time greatly affects success with this method.","https://www.ccsihau.ac.in/pdf/package-of-practices/Package-of-Practices-for-Cereals.pdf

This method involves broadcasting wheat seeds manually across a prepared field at a rate of 40-50 kg/acre. After seed scattering, farmers perform light plowing or harrowing to mix the seeds into the top 2-3 cm of soil. The key step involves dragging a wooden plank called a pora over the field to compact the soil and improve seed-to-soil contact. Immediate light irrigation follows to ensure proper germination.
This method offers several advantages for certain farming situations. It requires minimal equipment, making it accessible to small farmers without seed drills. The process is faster than mechanical drilling, which helps when sowing is delayed after paddy harvest. Pora works particularly well in light-textured sandy-loam soils where conventional drills may struggle. The soil compaction from planking helps retain moisture, which is beneficial in water-scarce conditions.

This region, including areas like Bathinda, Mansa, Fazilka, and Muktsar, is ideal for its cultivation due to the climate and soil type. The sowing window is crucial and typically falls between April 15th and May 15th. The crop is harvested from late September through November. Improved Varieties The Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, has released several high-yielding, pest-resistant varieties such as PAU Bt 1, PAU Bt 3, FMDH-9, and LH 2298. For Bt varieties, the recommended seed rate is 1.75 to 2.0 kg per acre. For non-Bt varieties, it is higher. A common spacing is 67.5 cm x 75 cm between rows and plants. Treating seeds with a fungicide before sowing is highly recommended to protect against seed-borne diseases, such as treating seeds with thiram 3gm/kg of seeds or imidacloprid @ 5-7 g/kg of seeds. It requires a balanced fertilizer such as Nitrogen 35 kg, Phosphorus 24 kg, Potassium 24 kg, and Sulphur 8 kg to achieve this. Apply 55 kg of DAP, 40 kg of MOP, 10 kg of zinc sulphate iit f shows zinc deficiency in the soil test. Its major pests are Whitefly, jassids, Flonicamid 50%WG @80 g/acre or imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 80 ml/acre or Thiamethoxam 25 WG @ 40 g/acre. Bollworms ( Pinkbollworm, Spotted Bollworms) to control, apply Profenfos 50% EC @ 80 ml/acre or Emamectin Benzoate 5% SG @ @100 g/acre.

A common issue faced is the yellowing of wheat crops, a symptom of stress rather than a single disease. Accurately identifying the cause is essential for effective treatment. Carefully observe the pattern of yellowing in the field. If the leaves show distinct yellow stripes parallel to the veins and release a yellow-orange powder when touched, the crop is likely suffering from Yellow Rust (Pili Kungi). This is a fungal disease that requires immediate attention. If the yellowing is uniform across the leaves without any stripes, it is likely a nutrient deficiency.

Varieties- Punjab Basmati 7 Strong aroma, excellent cooking and milling quality, Resistant to all 10 pathotypes of bacterial blight prevalent in Punjab, Matures in 101 days (earlier than Pusa Basmati 1121), Yield: 19.4 quintals/acre; performs well under DSR (Direct Seeded Rice) conditions.

And Pusa basmati 1718 ( variety is resistant to bacterial leaf blight, matures in 136-138 days after sowing). These varieties are known for their excellent grain quality, aroma, and yield potential and are preferred by farmers for Basmati rice cultivation.",https://www.pau.edu/content/ccil/pf/pp_kharif.pdf,"The problem of mango trees producing a heavy crop one year and a light or no crop the next is a well-known issue called Alternate Bearing, also referred to as a ""yearly break"" in production. This happens because a tree uses up its energy and nutrients to produce a huge crop in the ""on-year,"" leaving it exhausted for the next season. The fruits themselves produce hormones that also prevent new flower buds from forming. Certain varieties, like Dashehari and Langra, are naturally more prone to this than others. To get a consistent harvest every year, you need to use a combination of techniques. First, proper pruning is a critical step, especially for older, thick trees. The best time to prune is right after harvest, in June or July. By lightly pruning, you open up the tree's canopy, allowing sunlight and air to reach the inner branches. This encourages new shoots to grow, which will produce fruit the next year. Second, ensure your trees have balanced nutrition. A well-fed tree is better equipped to handle the stress of heavy fruiting. Apply fertilizers in two phases: the first in June-July after pruning and the second in September-October. A good mix includes Farm Yard Manure (FYM), Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potash. While a soil test is ideal for precise amounts, a mature tree generally needs 50-100 kg of FYM along with a mix of chemical fertilizers. Another effective technique is de-blossoming. In an ""on-year"" when the tree is flowering heavily, you can manually remove about 50-60% of the flower clusters. This prevents the tree from over-exhausting itself, allowing it to produce a moderate crop while saving enough energy to flower again the following year. Finally, for a highly effective chemical solution, you can use growth regulators like Paclobutrazol. This chemical works by temporarily stopping leafy growth and redirecting the tree's energy into producing new flower buds. It should be applied to the soil around the tree's trunk about three months before the normal flowering time, usually in September or October in most parts of India. The correct dosage is crucial and depends on the size of the tree's canopy. To use 3-4 ml of the chemical per meter of canopy diameter. The solution is poured into a small trench or a few holes dug around the tree's base. By consistently applying these methods, pruning, balanced fertilization, and, if necessary, de-blossoming or using growth regulators, you can help break the cycle of alternate bearing and ensure a more stable mango harvest year after year.",TRUE,-,,"Paddy is a kharif-season crop.

Instead, intercrop or use border crops like moong, urad, soybean, castor, or sorghum which disturb pest and disease build-up. After harvest, remove and burn crop residues to stop carryover. Manage irrigation properly so the crop doesn’t grow too lush, and apply fertilizers in balance, avoiding excess nitrogen which makes the crop more prone to disease. For biological control in cotton, apply about 1.2 trillion NPV POBs per acre during evening at 7th and 12th week; release 2.5 cc Trichogramma egg parasitoids per acre every 15 days three times from 45 days after sowing; and release approximately 40,500 Chelonus blackburnii and Chrysoperla carnea per acre at 6th, 13th, and 14th weeks for natural larvae control. For extra effect, ULV spray of NPV with cotton seed kernel extract, crude sugar, Tinopal and Teepol works well, and remember Dicofol, methyl demeton and phosalone are safer for friendly insects like Chrysoperla. For seed treatment, use Carboxin 37.5% + Thiram 37.5% DS @ 3.5 g/kg seed for root rot and blight, or Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10 g/kg seed for blight, and for seedling diseases treat with Fluxapyroxad @ 1.5 ml/kg seed or Tetraconazole @ 1.5 ml/kg seed. If infestation is seen in the field, drench symptomatic and nearby plants with Trichoderma harzianum or T. viride 1% WP @ 50 g in 10 litres water per acre, or with Carbendazim 50 WP @ 20 g in 10 litres water per acre. In case of sooty mould, spray Flonicamid 160 g, or Propiconazole 400 ml, or Copper Oxychloride 1 kg, each per acre in 400 litres of water.

Dange,"Paddy fields are susceptible to several fungal diseases that can severely impact crop yield and quality. The most common fungal infections affecting rice include blast, sheath blight, brown spot, false smut, bakanae disease, and stem rot, each requiring specific management approaches.
Blast disease looks like spindle-shaped lesions on leaves with gray centers and brown margins. For controlling it, you can use Tricyclazole 75% WP at 0.5 gm/liter of water (100-120 gm/acre) or Isoprothiolane 40% EC at 1.5 ml/liter (300-350 ml/acre). Recommended resistant varieties include Pusa Basmati 1121, CR Dhan 701, and IR 64, which show good tolerance against blast infection.
Sheath blight manifests as oval lesions on leaf sheaths near the water level. You can apply Validamycin 3% L at 2.5 ml/liter (500 ml/acre) or Hexaconazole 5% SC at 2 ml/liter (400 ml/acre) for effective control. Varieties like Swarna Sub-1, MTU 1010, and BPT 5204 demonstrate resistance to sheath blight.
Brown spot disease appears as small dark brown spots on leaves and can be managed using Mancozeb 75% WP at 2 gm/liter (400-500 gm/acre) or Carbendazim 50% WP at 1 gm/liter (200 gm/acre). IR 36 and CR 1009 are among the varieties showing tolerance to brown spot infection.
False smut has greenish-black spore balls on panicles. Control measures include spraying Propiconazole 25% EC at 1 ml/liter (200 ml/acre) or using Copper Oxychloride 50% WP at 2 gm/liter (500 gm/acre) as a preventive spray. PR 113 and Pusa 44 varieties exhibit resistance to false smut.
Bakanae disease, it looks abnormally tall, pale seedlings. Seed treatment with Carbendazim 50% WP at 2 gm/kg seed is effective, followed by foliar spray of Thio-phanate-methyl 70% WP at 1 gm/liter (200 gm/acre). Pusa Basmati 1509 and PB 1121 are resistant varieties against bakanae disease.
Stem rot shows black lesions on stems and can be controlled with a combination of Carbendazim 50% WP (1 gm/liter) and Mancozeb 75% WP (2 gm/liter), requiring 200 gm and 400 gm/acre, respectively. IR 50 and ADT 43 varieties show tolerance to stem rot infection.
For all fungicide applications, use 200-250 liters of water per acre for proper coverage (with a 20-30 days interval period). 
Preventive measures play a crucial role in disease management. Always use certified seeds of resistant varieties, maintain proper field sanitation by removing infected plant debris, avoid excessive nitrogen application, which can increase disease susceptibility, practice balanced fertilization, and ensure proper water management by avoiding continuous flooding conditions.",https://workdrive.zoho.in/file/7pdp39cbcfa4dc43441d49c0ad2c7a3d632ed. https://workdrive.zoho.in/file/694az1f8321a4f01f489b8d04b9c5ff084cfa. https://agritech.tnau.ac.in/agriculture/agri_pesticides_carbendazim.html,"Paddy fields are susceptible to several fungal diseases that can severely impact crop yield and quality.

","Paddy stubble and leftover plants should be destroyed promptly after harvest completion. In Punjab and surrounding regions, this destruction should ideally be completed before November 15 each year. Timely destruction prevents various insect pests from surviving and multiplying in the crop residues.
The yellow stem borer and pink stem borer larvae remain protected inside leftover stems. These borers cause dead hearts in young plants and white ear heads in mature crops during subsequent seasons. Leaf folder larvae also survive in crop residues, hiding within folded leaves where they damage plants by scraping green tissue.
Planthoppers, including the brown plant hopper and white-backed plant hopper, take shelter in stubble. These sap-sucking insects not only weaken plants but also transmit dangerous viral diseases. Heavy infestations lead to hopper burn symptoms. Armyworm caterpillars feed on remaining plant material before moving to new crops, capable of rapid defoliation. Rice hispa beetles and their grubs survive in stubble, causing characteristic white streaks on leaves of new plants. You can do deep ploughing to 10-12 inch depth, which completely buries stubble and associated pests. Chemical options involve spraying glyphosate at 10 ml/liter or paraquat at 5 ml/liter on standing stubble within one week post-harvest. These applications kill pests and prevent regrowth.",,"CRITICAL SAFETY ERROR: The Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) of 70-78 days is incorrect for the post-emergence herbicides listed.

The symptoms of iron deficiency are very distinct and almost always appear on the youngest or newly emerged leaves first. The most classic symptom is the yellowing of the leaf tissue between the veins, while the veins themselves remain green. This gives the leaves a striped or netted appearance. In severe cases, the entire leaf, including the veins, will turn yellow and may eventually become paper-white. Affected plants will be stunted, with reduced height and fewer tillers (side shoots). The deficiency is often first observed in the paddy nursery, where seedlings will look pale yellow and weak. If not corrected, the seedlings may die. If you know your field has a history of iron deficiency, you can apply Ferrous Sulphate to the soil. Apply 10 kg of Ferrous Sulphate per acre. Mix the Ferrous Sulphate with sand or dry soil for even distribution and broadcast it in the field before transplanting or at the time of final puddling.

The symptoms of zinc deficiency are quite distinct and usually appear on the younger leaves first. Small, scattered, reddish-brown spots (like rust) appear on the lower part of the younger leaves. These spots enlarge and merge, and the entire leaf takes on a bronze or dusty brown color. Eventually, the affected leaves dry up and die. The plant's growth is severely restricted, leading to a stunted and unhealthy appearance. Tillering (the growth of side shoots) is significantly reduced. In the field, you'll notice uneven growth, with patches of stunted, unhealthy-looking plants. The crop's maturity is often delayed, leading to a longer duration in the field. Zinc deficiency isn't always because the soil lacks zinc, but often because the zinc is unavailable for the plant to absorb. To control zinc deficiency in paddy, you can use a preventive Measure (Soil Application): This is the best long-term solution for fields with a known history of zinc deficiency. Apply 10 kg of Zinc Sulphate (21%) per acre. Apply it at the time of the final puddling, just before transplanting the paddy. This ensures it's well-mixed in the root zone.

First thing is, always get your soil tested from PAU or KVK lab, that way you will know what exactly your land needs. Before transplanting, add about 6 tonnes FYM per acre, this keeps soil alive and fertile. If you rotate paddy with wheat or pulses, the land stays healthy and pests also go down. Along with that, you can mix biofertilizers like Azospirillum or PSB with manure, this makes nutrients available easily to the plant. For chemical dose on medium soil, PAU says give 90 kg nitrogen (urea), split in three parts – one thrid at the time of  transplanting, one third at tillering after 20 days, and again one third at panicle stage around 45 days. Give 45 to 50 kg phosphorus (DAP or SSP) and 40 kg potash (MOP) only if soil test says low potash. If you are using DAP, remember it already gives some nitrogen, so cut urea accordingly. For foliar support, spray Potassium nitrate 1.5% (3 kg in 200 liters water per acre) at booting stage, this helps in grain filling. Always use neem-coated urea instead of normal urea, this saves nitrogen loss and saves money. Treat seed with Carbendazim 2 gram per kg (applied only under expert guidance as it have under some restriction) or for safe you can use Trichoderma 5 g per kg or thiram 3 gram per kg of seeds to keep fungus away. Fertilizer should always go in moist soil and then give irrigation for absorption. Don’t flood field when applying urea, otherwise nutrients will wash away. In Punjab, PAU varieties like PR 126, PR 113, PR 132 are best; PR 126 needs around 90 kg N/acre, PR 132 can manage with less, about 67.5 kg N/acre.

The farming practices and government policies in place are specifically designed to support its cultivation. Nurseries for raising paddy seedlings are typically sown in May.

Chemical Control (Spray): Imidacloprid 17.8% SL: 0.3–0.4 ml per liter of water, or 60–80 ml per acre in 200 liters of water. Pre-harvest interval (PHI): Maintain at least a 30-day gap between the last spray and harvest. Spray timing: When pest population reaches the economic threshold level (ETL): 4–5 insects per tiller or visible curling/yellowing. Prefer spraying in the morning or evening for better absorption and to avoid evaporation. Cultural and Safety Measures: Keep the field weed-free to reduce alternate hosts. Do not mix Confidor with strong alkaline pesticides or fertilizers, Wear gloves, a mask, and protective clothing; avoid direct contact. Keep treated seeds away from children and pets.",https://pau.edu/content/ccil/pf/pp_rabi.pdf https://pau.edu/content/extserv/fo/3.pdf https://www.cropscience.bayer.in/en/protect-crops/insecticides-en/confidor https://www.entomoljournal.com/archives/2019/vol7issue3/PartI/7-3-7-687.pdf

Dange,"Paddy is a kharif season (June-July) crop, in which the pink stem borer is a significant pest affecting paddy crops in Punjab. This pest causes damage by creating 'dead hearts' during the vegetative stage and white ear heads during the reproductive stage. For controlling it, you should choose resistant varieties like PR 126, which demonstrates moderate resistance against stem borers, while PR 127 shows good tolerance to pink stem borer attacks. PAU 201, developed by Punjab Agricultural University, offers better borer resistance. PAU 202 is another suitable variety with moderate pest tolerance specifically bred for Punjab's growing conditions.

Controlling grasshoppers (often called Tidda in Punjabi) requires an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach. First, you need to determine if the number of grasshoppers in your field is high enough to cause actual financial loss. This is called the Economic Threshold Level (ETL). You should only consider chemical control when the population reaches or exceeds: 5-10 grasshoppers per sweep with a standard insect net, or an average of 2 grasshoppers per hill. The most important step is to trim the grass on and around the field bunds. Grasshoppers lay their eggs and multiply on these grassy bunds. Keeping them clean destroys their habitat and breeding grounds. In the early stages of infestation, you can run a rope across the crop to dislodge the grasshoppers, causing them to fall into the paddy water, where many will drown. If you have monitored your field and the grasshopper population is above the ETL, you can use a chemical spray such as Quinalphos 25% EC @ 800 ml in 150-200 Litres (PHI-7-15 Days), or Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC @ 200 ml in 150-200 Litres (PHI-7-15 Days).

Since the fungus grows internally within the seed, prevention through seed treatment is crucial.

https://irac-online.org/modes-of-action/","Demak / Loose smut It is a seed-borne fungal disease affecting wheat crops in Punjab. The disease appears at the flowering stage, replacing grains with black powdery spores. Since the fungus grows internally within the seed, prevention through seed treatment is crucial. Several wheat varieties show resistance to loose smut in Punjab conditions, like HD 2967, which demonstrates moderate resistance against the disease. PBW 725 offers good resistance to both loose smut and rust diseases. WH 1105 shows tolerance to smut and other foliar diseases. PBW 550, recommended for Punjab, provides moderate resistance. Always use certified seeds from your retailer shop. Also, you can use Carboxin 37.5% + Thiram 37.5% WS (Vitavax Power) 2 gm/kg of seed. Tebuconazole 2% DS (Raxil 2 DS) works effectively at 1.5 gm/kg of seed, controlling both loose smut and bunt.

Phosphorus Solubilising Bacteria (PSB): These microorganisms solubilise insoluble phosphorus compounds in the soil, converting them into a form readily available for plant uptake. Azospirillum: This bacterium helps in nitrogen fixation and promotes plant growth. Sulphur Solubilising Bacteria: These bacteria assist in making sulfur available to plants. Application method: Biofertilizers are typically applied as a seed treatment. Prepare a solution by dissolving 200–300 grams of jaggery in one litre of warm water. Allow the solution to cool, then mix in the contents of the appropriate biofertilizer packet (e.g., Azotobacter for wheat). Evenly coat the wheat seeds with the solution and allow them to dry in the shade. Sow the treated seeds within 12 hours of drying.",https://ppqs.gov.in/sites/default/files/bio-fungicide_31.3.2024.pdf https://www.icar.org.in/sites/default/files/2022-09/Rabi-Agro-Advisory-2021-22_0.pdf https://niphm.gov.in/IPMPackages/Wheat.pdf

These tender leaves contain more sap, amino acids, and sugars, which act as “ready food” for many sucking pests such as aphids, whiteflies, jassids, and leafhoppers, as well as caterpillars. Because the plant tissues remain soft, pests can easily suck or chew them, making the crop more attractive to attacks. Furthermore, excessive nitrogen can harm the quality of your soil by increasing its acidity and reducing its overall health over time, potentially leading to deficiencies in other vital nutrients. It can even lead to nitrate leaching, contaminating groundwater, which can affect human and animal health. To prevent these issues, it is best to base your nitrogen application on soil tests and follow the recommended doses for your specific region and wheat variety, including using balanced and integrated nutrient management with both organic and inorganic sources of nutrients.

This process focuses on identifying and managing common threats to the crop. The primary concern is rusts, including Yellow Rust and Brown Rust, which can severely damage the crop. Other diseases like Karnal Bunt, Loose Smut, and Powdery Mildew are also monitored. Common pests include aphids (which suck plant sap), pink stem borers (which attack seedlings), and termites. Armyworms and cutworms can also cause significant damage by consuming entire fields.  Inspections occur at different stages of the crop's growth, from the early vegetative stage to just before harvest.

https://www.pau.edu/content/ccil/pf/pp_rabi.pdf","The time to avoid irrigation depends mainly on the crop, soil type, growth stage, and weather, but in general, it is advisable not to irrigate just before or after certain critical events like immediately after fertilizer or pesticide application (unless it’s meant to be incorporated). it is required to wait at least 24 hours to prevent nutrient loss or chemical wash-off.  For Urea, irrigation must be applied immediately after broadcasting to dissolve the granules and prevent significant nitrogen loss to the atmosphere.

 Irrigation decisions must always be crop-specific. In paddy, irrigation should be avoided at the time of grain ripening, since excess water at maturity delays harvest and lowers grain quality. 
In onion, over-irrigation during the maturity and bulb-drying stage should be avoided, as it reduces storability and causes rotting.
 For mustard, irrigation must not be given at the flowering and pod-maturity stage, because excess moisture encourages diseases and shattering. In most vegetables, especially cucurbits and solanaceous crops, irrigation should be avoided during flowering and immediately before harvest, as water stress or excess moisture at these stages can either reduce fruit set or affect keeping quality. 

Before harvest of crops like paddy, groundnut, onion, or sugarcane  the usual practice is to stop irrigation for 7–15 days before harvest to allow proper drying and improve quality.
